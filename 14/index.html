          <p>If you look at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexeymk">my LinkedIn account</a>, it would seem like I'm not a particularly active user; I've only got&nbsp;<del>79</del> 74 connections and no picture. &nbsp;Here's the thing: I'm not sure if I'm using it right.</p>
<p>My LinkedIn 'friending' policy is simple: I'll accept a connection if the person offering it is somebody who I would feel comfortable recommending if somebody asked "hey, do you know any good ____?" &nbsp;Unless I've worked with somebody, am personally friends with them, or have had the kind of conversation where I can sort of smell competence, I probably am not comfortable being a LinkedIn connection of theirs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a reasonably good chance that I'm wrong. My friend Yujin, an MBA who now does bizdev for Venture Capital, says I should be friending most business connections I make and that this is the norm for LinkedIn. &nbsp;As a result, Yujin's got <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/yujinchung">500+ connections</a>&nbsp;and is the ultimate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connector_(social)">connector</a>. &nbsp;And he rocks it. &nbsp;Still, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of being a connection (and, effectively, agreeing to be a reference for) somebody who I don't yet trust.</p>
<p><img src="/images/invite_to_connect_on_linkedin.png" alt="Loose Ties Link Ships:  Friending norms on LinkedIn" /></p>
<p>LinkedIn seems to at least somewhat agree with me on this; when I try to add a new contact, it warns me to add only 'people you know well and who know you.' &nbsp;And yet,&nbsp;I've had a number of (reasonably respectable) random people add me as a LinkedIn connection as a way to get an introduction. &nbsp;There's a reasonable chance that this is because they can't find my email address and LinkedIn tries to make money by offering 'direct contact via inMail' as a premium feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One solution to the whole friending strong versus weak ties (which, esp. when compared to Facebook's or Twitter's, probably deserves its own post) is LinkedIn's endorsements feature. &nbsp;If you really want to show that you trust somebody, endorse them by writing a positive recommendation. &nbsp;Still, I can't bring myself to 'accept' people I would not (yet) comfortable hiring or working for. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a social rolodex where I can can add anybody I've ever met, without any implied friendship or any fears of references or privacy. &nbsp;This is <em>almost</em>&nbsp;what Twitter is, except that I'm not particularly interested in what random people I've met once have had for lunch. &nbsp;What I would (ideally) like is a social, digital rolodex, sorted by time and (perhaps) with some sort of tagging features, so I can mark people by the things we share in common.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm just old-fashioned. &nbsp;What are your LinkedIn 'connection' policies?</p>

          <p><em>I gave a talk at <a href="http://www.barcampphilly.org/">BarCamp Philly</a>&nbsp;a couple of months back about best practices in hiring technical (mostly CS) interns from Penn. I've since distilled the talk into bitesize pieces and plan to publish its remnants here, starting with the Who and the Where. &nbsp;If we haven't met, I'm a CS Junior @ Penn.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://content.screencast.com/users/AlexeyMK/folders/Jing/media/a95a90bf-fac9-4255-a258-8580865dcadd/2010-12-28_1750.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>You've figured that, for whatever reason, you want to recruit some Engineering/CS talent from Penn to work with you on something, either in an internship or a partnership capacity. That's cool. We'll re-examine the assumption that a Penn CS student is who you really need in a later post, but let's continue on for now.</p>
<p>Unless you come from Penn Engineering and/or have a CS background, though, it's not entirely clear what you should be doing to reach out. Here's what you need to know:</p>
<p><strong> Who we are</strong></p>
<p>As everywhere, the culture varies and stereotypes aren't particularly welcome. We've got <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~thetatau/">frats</a>, we've got gamers, we've got <a href="http://upenn.siggraph.org/games.html">game makers</a>, we've got <a href="http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/">the kind of science and technology geeks who decided it might be fun to launch a blimp</a>, we've got all kinds. We're engineers. It's a good mix.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://content.screencast.com/users/AlexeyMK/folders/Jing/media/3bbfe2ec-aba2-445a-b559-33a82428dc06/2010-12-28_1802.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In terms of your competition, here's a rough estimate as to the type of work students are looking for. Google doesn't just mean Google in this case, it means large, successful engineering-driven tech company.</p>
<p>Pixar's representation is a result of the <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd/">Digital Media Design</a> program. DMD students are known for (at least to me) as being able to draw and handle graphics, while at the same time being able to out-code you any day. They're kind of impressive.</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs/financial side of the pie chart is a result of Wharton School/New York influence. We have a disproportionally large amount of Wharton dual-degree/<a href="http://www.upenn.edu/fisher/">M&amp;T</a>&nbsp;students studying things like Finance &amp; CS, who end up going to work for investment banks and hedge funds. Since a lot of these financial companies are on campus, they end up recruiting from CS reasonably heavily. I'm doing my best to withhold judgement here.</p>
<p>Finally, the 'start my own company' group is a small but growing one, bolstered by recent successes like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/03/google-confirms-invite-media/">Invite Media</a> and <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/entrepreneurship/2010/12/02/ebay-buys-local-shopping-site-milo">Milo</a>, two recent Penn CS start-ups. We're growing. This is a good time to be at Penn.</p>
<p>In appealing to Penn CS students, try to figure out whether you fit into any of these categories reasonably well, since these are going to affect who and how you pitch your proposed employment.</p>
<p><strong>How to reach us</strong></p>
<p>From broad to personal, here's a list of ways to reach out to students studying CS@Penn:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/pennlink_employers.html">PennLink</a>&nbsp;is Penn's official on-campus recruiting website. I can't vouch for it, though: my only experience with PennLink was when looking for a summer internship my Sophomore year. Back then, most of the jobs available seemed generic (consulting, etc) and the technical jobs were mainly by large corporations that I wasn't interested in. I'm not sure how well other CS majors have fared on PennLink, though.</li>
<li><a href="http://pennstudentdesign.com/">Penn Student Design</a> is an internal 'web design' guild run largely out of DMD. If you're looking to have a freelancer-type arrangement help you make your website look impressive, contacting PSD makes a lot of sense.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jackie/">Jackie Caliman</a>&nbsp;is the Associate Director for Advising of the undergraduate CS department. Let me digress and say that there are no words to describe the sheer awesomeness that is Jackie. &nbsp;If every organization has a person behind the scenes keeping the whole thing together; for us, that's Jackie Calman. &nbsp;<br />The reason that's relevant is because Jackie sends out CS list-serv emails on behalf of potential employers. Most of the interesting job opportunities I end up seeing come from that list-serv; I'd recommend reaching out to Jackie to see if she'll forward your email on. &nbsp;That said, we get a lot of reasonably painful-to-read emails. I'll discuss exactly how to put together a good pitch to a CS student in a later post.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pennapps.com">PennApps.com</a>&nbsp;[shameless plug] is a twice-yearly, student-run weekend-long hackathon that brings out a lot of the top 'I can make something really fast' hacker-types out. If you can afford it, (IE, if you're funded) you should sponsor - we do our best to help sponsors meet and recruit top participants for internships. If not, you should show up to demo session and see what people are up to.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pennlaunch.com">PennLaunch</a>&nbsp;is a sort of internal LinkedIn for Penn, focusing on specific projects people are working on. Run by the <a href="http://www.tech-house.upenn.edu/">Weiss Tech House</a>, the site hasn't reached it's potential yet (IE, not enough engineers are on it), but it's getting there.</li>
<li><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dFlZWlJxSWNIYXJHUFd6Q1ZtbmpZVEE6MQ">Penn StartupConnect</a> and <a href="http://startupspeeddating.weebly.com/">Startup Speed Dating</a> are twice-yearly events run by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joshwais">Josh Wais</a> and <a href="http://blog.careercup.com/">Gayle Laakhman</a>, respectively. The two use slightly different formats, but the idea is the same: get people from the business/tech side of things into the same room and let them take it from there. Watch out for these if you're in the Philly area.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/departmental/faculty/">Professors </a>are often worth meeting with, especially if you've figured out what particular field (Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, etc) you need talent in. &nbsp;If they like you, they may just introduce you to some of their top students.</li>
<li>Last, there's always old-school networking. Ask around - see who you know who can introduce you to somebody who is part of the community. [Another shameless plug] I'll typically have lunch with anybody interesting that offers to the detriment of work that needs to be done.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>That's +/- it. Let me know if you have any questions and if there's anything in particular I should address in future posts.</p>

          <p><span style="color: #7e7e7e; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><em>Professor Jason Dana and I have been experimenting with Cheating and Turker Quality on Mechanical Turk. If you haven't yet, check out <a href="flipping-coins-through-mechanical-turk-part-1">Part 1</a>. Thanks for everybody's feedback so far - please keep it coming.</em></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Recap</strong></p>
<p>When we left off, we had just offered workers on Mechanical Turk the job of flipping a coin, paying them 4 cents for a flip of heads and 2 cents for tails. We wanted to measure whether and how much particular groups of Turkers, bucketed by their quality score, would cheat when given the chance to do so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Though our <a href="alexeymk.com/flipping-coins-through-mechanical-turk-part-1#results">initial results</a> seemed to suggest a positive relationship between having a high quality score and not cheating, the amount of data collected was less than desired and did not have the numbers required for statistical significance.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment Two </strong></p>
<p>Realizing the difficulty of attracting top Turkers to a task that offered only two cents, we decided to up the ante and make two changes: first, we renamed the task to a more attractive "One quick question. Should take ~15 seconds." &nbsp;Second, we raised the price of heads and tails to 10c and 5c, respectively. &nbsp;Once again, we asked 50 Turkers in each of our quality groups to flip a coin, for a total of 300 coin-flips.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Here's what we got. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/images/5c-10c_chart.png" alt="Flipping Coins through Mechanical Turk: Part 2" /></p>
<p><em>Note: Error bars are at a 95% confidence interval.</em></p>
<p>This time around, all 300 HITs (tasks) we put out were done in a matter of days. The data, however, became less clear: sure, we expected the &lt;90% and 94-90% groups to cheat a ton (as they did), but what was the 100% group, the 'cream of the crop' doing by taking advantage of our trust and cheating as much as the lowest group, &lt;90%? &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>This bothered us for a while. &nbsp;Who <strong>are </strong>these 100%-ers, after all? This is the group that can do no wrong, the group that makes less than 1 error in 100. How could they have betrayed our trust, especially after we offered them <strong>more </strong>money?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Melika&nbsp;Cavagnaro-Wong, a&nbsp;friend from Wharton, provided the key insight here: 100%-ers aren't necessarily the group that can do no wrong. They're just the group that never gets caught.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>
<p>I imagine a contingent of Turkers who have optimized their workflow to a tee. It's not easy to make a solid hourly wage from Turking, so one has to maximize productivity. Tasks below a certain financial payout or that take too long to do are not an option. HITs where quality can be ensured (identifying objects in images, transcribing audio) are only worthwhile if they pay well. HITs that can be easily gamed, however (multiple-choice surveys, coin-flips) are ripe for cheating - why not?<img src="/images/Mafia_lgo.jpg" alt="Flipping Coins through Mechanical Turk: Part 2" /></p>
<p>In an extreme state of the world, I imagine a cabal of Turkers somewhere, collaborating to maximize their effective hourly wage. Members would take turns looking at new tasks and figuring out (or even using software to measure) the expected hourly wage of a particular task. Other members in the group would then be sent links to the 'juiciest' tasks, and some sort of queue system would be used to manage what a particular cabal member's next task ought to be. &nbsp;<em>Note: we're looking into whether we can trace any evidence of something like this and will post about them at a later point.</em></p>
<p>Why, then did this hyper-efficient cabal not invade our 2c/4c experiment? Quite simply, the 2 cents advertised (the other 2c came as a bonus) initially likely flew well below their radar as a task not worth any time at all. Instead, the 19 people who did come to us from the 100% group are more likely to be the 'part-timers' - people who answered<span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Trebuchet MS, sans-serif; line-height: 16px;"><a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2008/09/why-people-participate-on-mechanical.html">Panos Ipeirotis'&nbsp;</a></span><a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2008/09/why-people-participate-on-mechanical.html">'W</a></span><a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2008/09/why-people-participate-on-mechanical.html">hy do you Turk' survey</a> with either "it's fun" or "it's rewarding." &nbsp;This group is not financially motivated and less likely to cheat.</p>
<p>These altruistic Turkers are a minority, however; once money comes into play, they get <a href="http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2007/06/waldby.html">Crowded In</a>&nbsp;by the 100% optimizers. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Crowding In</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In behavioral economics, crowding in is the idea that paying too much for a task may get the wrong kind of people to do it. A classic example of crowding in is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation#Benefits_and_incentives">paying for blood donations</a>, outlawed in the US and most of the rest of the world for several decades now. The problem, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Titmuss">Richard Titmuss</a> described in&nbsp;<span style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px;"><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gift-Relationship-Human-Social-Policy/dp/1565844033">The Gift Relationship: From Human Blood to Social Policy</a>, </em>is that offering cash for blood gets the exact wrong kind of blood donor: the type that could really go for some cash <em>right now </em>and therefore may not have the cleanest blood available. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">Similarly, as we offer increasingly larger enticements to participate in the coin flip experiment, we seem to be crowding the 'doing this for fun' crowd out in favor of the 'optimizer' crowd. The effect should be particularly evident in the 100% group, where both a lot of altruists and a lot of optimizers are likely to end up, altruists because they do good work and optimizers because it pays to be qualified for restrictive tasks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Experiment</strong></p>
<p>Luckily, this turned out to be a reasonably simple thing to test. Taking the 100%-ers as our experiment and 95-97% as our control group, we offered the same coin-flip experiment to 50 participants in each group and altering the payment for tails/heads to, one after the other, 10c/15c and 3c/8c. We kept the bonus at 5 cents and altering only the original offer, since the base payment is the only number Turkers can see before accepting the HIT.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><img src="/images/percent-heads-by-reward.png" alt="Flipping Coins through Mechanical Turk: Part 2" />Note: Error bars are at a 95% confidence interval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span>From our experiment, it looks like while offering more money leads to <strong>more cheating</strong>&nbsp;for the 100% group, cheating actually goes <strong>down </strong>for the 95-97% control group.&nbsp;This fits with our hypothesis: in the 95-97% group, adding more money disincentives cheating -&nbsp;5 cents for cheating looks less enticing if I've already received 10 cents and more enticing if I've only received 3.&nbsp;Dishonesty can be bought, but only at a reasonable multiplier to the base reward. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 100% group, however, the opposite occurs: the more money is offered, the more interesting the task becomes to optimizers, and optimizers cheat whenever they can get away with it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The results are not&nbsp;<em>quite&nbsp;</em>statistically significant, as the error bars illustrate, but they tell a reasonably compelling story nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you agree with our hypothesis? &nbsp;What other, alternate explanations might exist for these results?</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
<p>We collected additional data about the Turkers as we conducted our experiment. Here's some of the analysis I intend for Part 3:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cheating by Time Taken: </strong>Can we predict whether a Turker really flipped a coin or not by looking at how long the assignment took them?</li>
<li><strong>Cabal Trends: </strong>Can we identify any collusion amongst Turkers? &nbsp;Assuming Turkers share tasks, are there any patterns of heads-heads-heads-heads... in our data within a fairly short time span?</li>
<li><strong>National Trends: </strong>Most Turkers (&gt;90%, in our case)&nbsp;are either in the US or in India. Do Americans or Indians cheat more? Is either group more likely to be 100%-ers? Are Americans less likely to accept low-paying tasks? We started tracking IPs only by the time we ran the 3c/8c and 10c/15c groups, but even that subset of data points remain interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any ideas for other interesting analysis I should run?</p>

          <p><em>Over the past semester, I participated in an Independent Study in Behavioral Economics with Professor Jason Dana.&nbsp; Here's what we've been up to</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Tur</strong><strong>k </strong>is Amazon's 'artificial artificial intelligence' service.<img src="/images/250px-Kempelen_chess1.jpg" alt="Flipping Coins through Mechanical Turk: Part 1" /> Named after a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk">fake chess-playing machine</a> in the late 17th-18th century, According to Amazon, MTurk is a</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">marketplace for work that requires human intelligence. The Mechanical Turk web service enables companies to programmatically access this marketplace and a diverse, on-demand workforce. Developers can leverage this service to build human intelligence directly into their appli</span><em></em><span style="font-size: small;">cations</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/is-amazons-mechanical-turk-a-failure.html">Jeff Atwood explains</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">It's a service that attempts to match people to small, bite-size units of work that are unsuitable for machines.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example: You have a list of thousands websites and want to know which ones are appear to be well-designed. Algorithms to quantify taste do not yet (sadly) exist; instead, either look through the websites yourself, or offer the task to Mechanical Turk. Turkers, as the workers are called, are then paid 5 cents (or however much you offer) to rate each website. Hundreds of people can work on your classification task in parralel, saving time and money.<em></em></p>
<p>Common uses of Mechanical Turk include transcribing audio, identifying photos, or answering opinion surveys.</p>
<p><strong>The Cheating Problem</strong></p>
<p>Without oversight, what prevents Turkers from voting randomly? For objective tasks, you could manually go over each result yourself, but this would be exteremely time-intensive and defeat the purpose. For subjective tasks, even that wouldn't be possible - who knows if the Turker's choice of 3/10 for some website was<em></em> his actual opinion or a random choice?</p>
<p>There are a couple of approaches that work here. You could try to get multiple Turkers to do each task and make sure they agree on the answers.&nbsp; You could do part of the work yourself, (set a <strong>gold standard</strong>) and verify Turker quality by how well they do on the tasks to which you now know the right answers. Finally, you can restrict your Turker employee base to a highly-qualified one, limiting your employee pool to those who have done good work before.&nbsp; As a side note, companies like <a href="http://crowdflower.com/">CrowdFlower</a> try to restrict and manage for high-quality workers on your behalf; if you're willing to pay more for your automated tasks, I've heard good things about them.</p>
<p>Amazon measures this 'done good work before' metric by looking at the Turker's <strong>HIT Approval Rate - </strong>the % of tasks that this worker has done in the past that were subsequently accepted by the employer. Limiting your workers to 95%+ is a standard way of trying to obtain only high-quality responses.</p>
<p><strong>The Research Question</strong></p>
<p>The question, then, is whether limiting the Turkers to those with a high acceptance rate is an effective way of making sure they don't cheat.&nbsp; We were also wondering where the cutoff for cheaters was and whether the amount of money offered for the task would affect the amount of cheating.<em></em></p>
<p><strong>The Setup<br /></strong></p>
<p>Our experiment is as simple as possible:<em><span style="font-style: normal;"><em></em></span><img src="/images/flipacoin.png" alt="Flipping Coins through Mechanical Turk: Part 1" /></em><em></em></p>
<p>The idea is based on an experiment Prof. Dana has run at Solomon Behavioral Labs at Penn as well as abroad [that we should probably link to/cite here].&nbsp; We can't tell if any particular individual is cheating - perhaps they happened to flip heads - but in the aggregate, if we ask 50 homogenous Turkers to flip a coin and see how many heads we get, 50 heads indicates that the Turkers are a dishonest bunch, while 25 heads and 25 tails would indicate a fair and friendly group of turkers.</p>
<p>We offered the same task to 50 turkers in one of several groups, varying by <strong>HIT Approval Rate. </strong><span style="font-family: mceinline;">An informal survey (IE, we asked one of Prof. Dana's grad students)</span> suggested that cutoffs of &lt;89%, 90-94%, 95-97%, 98-99% and 100% would be reasonable. We also offered the task to a group of Turk newbies (filtered by the fact that they had less than 20 tasks completed under their belt).</p>
<p>Offering 2c for tails and 4c for heads, we hoped to see how rampant cheating for subjective tasks was amongst various groups of accom<em></em>plishment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="results">The Results</a></strong><em><img src="/images/results_2c4c.PNG" alt="Flipping Coins through Mechanical Turk: Part 1" /></em>The data did not dissapoint. Excluding the 95-97% anomaly, the trend was clear: the better your Turkers, the more honest (by and large) they would be when offered subjective tasks where they could cheat without being detected.</p>
<p>Since this was our first attempt at Mechanical Turk, though, we did not do as good of a job with the price offered or the marketing of the task (we named it 'Project Random'). As a result, we got only 158 participants (out of a possible 300), and only 19 100%-ers.&nbsp; Clearly, the price offered would have to go up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you think offering more money affected the cheating chart? Should cheating go up or down, as a whole, if we offer 5c/10c instead of 2c/4c? Should any groups be more or less affected than average by an increased incentive to cheat?</p>

          <p>Quick heads-up, in case anybody else runs into this problem.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Background</span>:</strong></p>
<p>I've been working with passing an ExternalQuestion to MechanicalTurk, and have learned (the hard way) that the 'ExternalURL' component, set up as a "xs:anyURI" in the MTurk AWS schema, does not allow ampersands '&amp;' except if escaped via '&amp;amp;'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was not at all obvious. The AWS exception gives is:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;CreateHITResponse&gt;
  &lt;OperationRequest&gt;
    &lt;RequestId&gt;...&lt;/RequestId&gt;
  &lt;/OperationRequest&gt;
  &lt;HIT&gt;
    &lt;Request&gt;
      &lt;IsValid&gt;False&lt;/IsValid&gt;
      &lt;Errors&gt;
        &lt;Error&gt;
          &lt;Code&gt;AWS.MechanicalTurk.XMLParseError&lt;/Code&gt;
          &lt;Message&gt;There was an error parsing the XML question or answer data in your request.  Please make sure the data is well-formed and validates against the appropriate schema. (1291006584155 s)&lt;/Message&gt;
        &lt;/Error&gt;
      &lt;/Errors&gt;
    &lt;/Request&gt;
  &lt;/HIT&gt;/
&lt;/CreateHITResponse&gt;</pre></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Solution:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Replace any instance of &amp; in the ExternalQuestion URI (IE, <a href="http://www.yoursite.com/mturk/a.php?foo=true&amp;bar=false">www.yoursite.com/mturk/a.php?foo=true&amp;bar=false</a>) with &amp;amp;&nbsp;(IE, <a href="http://www.yoursite.com/mturk/a.php?foo=true&amp;amp;bar=false">www.yoursite.com/mturk/a.php?foo=true&amp;amp;bar=false</a>).</span></p>
<p>That'll fix it.</p>
