          <h3 id="i-still-remember-the-first-project-i-ever-worked-on-that-went-viral">I still remember the first project I ever worked on that went viral.</h3>

<p><a href="http://pennapps.com">Cobol on Rails</a> was a re-design of the Penn’s online Course Review system. The original was written as a Senior Design project a decade ago and kept on life support by the University IT.  It was (by the time we got to it) rather outdated.  It looked like this.</p>

<p><img src="/images/original_pcr.png" alt="Original PCR" /></p>

<p>Cobol on Rails was built in PHP and mySQL. It was the first serious web project that a few friends and I undertook. The Course Review folks were a student-run group who had been trying to find somebody to take over web responsibilities. They were willing to share the data.</p>

<p>We worked weekend after weekend, in 12-hour sprints, learning things like what the hell a border-radius was.  I still recall var_dump as a fond friend; good times.</p>

<p>It worked.  I emailed a link the Course Review folks.  “We’re done, check it out!”  A few of the others emailed their friends.</p>

<p>A few days later, we were on <a href="http://underthebutton.com">Under the Button</a>, a well-read student newspaper blog.  The initial emails had gone viral as students started to pick their next classes., leading to a couple of thousand unique visitors a day. Every minute between classes that day was spent glued to email, responding to feedback and answering questions. My heart was racing.</p>

<p>The Course Review folks emailed us too. “I can’t believe you guys did this,” they wrote.  “You promised not to start a competitor!  The Dean is not happy.”</p>

<p>We had to password-protect the thing (the password was ‘password’, and you could tell it you viewed the source).  Students went back to using the crappy old site, and the Course Review folks were mad enough at us to not take any of our advice about UX improvements seriously.  The experience stuck with me - the substantial improvement we made, and the politics that brought back the status quo.</p>

<h3 id="i-was-friends-with-cynthia-from-penns-student-government">I was friends with Cynthia from Penn’s Student Government.</h3>
<p>She was spending the summer working on student textbooks.  The problem was this: Penn’s bookstore made absurd margins buying back used books.</p>

<p>The old, student-run book exchange (BetterThanTheBookstore.com) had closed.  In the summer of 2010, following Princeton’s lead, Penn’s Student Government decided to start their own Book Exchange, <a href="http://pennua.org/textbook">Penn Book Bazaar</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>** Cynthia **: “You know Django, can you make this thing work for us?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had no desire whatsoever to be a peon for the Student Government.  They went ahead and did it on their own. The result was simple but not ugly and pretty successful.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pbb.png" alt="Penn Book Bazaar" /></p>

<p>Marketing isn’t so hard if you can email the entire school whenever you’d like.</p>

<h3 id="meanwhile-we-hosted-our-first-undergraduate-hackathon-pennappshttppennappscom">Meanwhile, we hosted our first undergraduate hackathon, <a href="http://pennapps.com">PennApps</a>.</h3>

<p>The winning team built an app called <a href="http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/productivity/seasprint_lapw.html">SEASPrint</a>, which let students print anywhere in the engineering school directly from their phone.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn6.staztic.com/cdn/thumb/seasprint-1-1.jpg" alt="SEASPrint" /></p>

<p>SEASPrint was awesome, and was more than a prototype - it worked. I used it all throughout college. With time, it would probably start to fall over unless somebody made sure it was up-to-date, and would be forgotten unless discoverable.  But the team had no particular interest in supporting it long term. That sucked.</p>

<h2 id="eventually-it-clicked">Eventually, it clicked</h2>

<p>Campus tech does not have to suck. Apps do not have to become outdated or unsupported. Developers don’t have to quarrel with the administration.</p>

<p>Working on campus tech can be rewarding, and deserving of talented engineers’ time. Building something your friends use feels great.</p>

<p>And so, we started <a href="http://labs.pennapps.com">PennApps Labs</a>, a student-run development shop that creates, adopts and maintains student-run campus tech.
<img src="/images/labs_logo.png" alt="Labs Logo" /></p>

<p>** PennApps Labs in a nutshell **</p>

<ul>
  <li>PennApps Labs pays ~5 students a semester TA-like wages to create new applications or update existing ones.</li>
  <li>Funding comes from the school’s administration and Student Government, which makes cooperation with existing organizations substantially less painful.</li>
  <li>Other successful student-created projects are supported and promoted, with a potential goal of adoption. Labs helps good projects from becoming stale and lost in the sands of time.</li>
  <li>PennApps Labs projects strive to be open.  That means open-sourcing whenever possible, accepting and soliciting community contributions, and establishing open APIs for any data created as a side-effect.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="labs-readme">Labs README</h3>
<p>I believe Labs is a model worth forking. The problems Penn’s campus tech faces are not substantially different from the problems at scores of other schools.  The sorts of problems that Labs aims to fix benefit from outside collaboration and contributions.</p>

<p>I am working on a README that should serve as a guide for starting a sister organization at another school. Drop me a line if you’d be interested in trying something similar are your school, and I’ll make it a priority.</p>

          <p><em>Warning: Boris and Alex are friends and former classmates. I am utterly biased.</em></p>

<h2 id="crowdfunding-doesnt-work">Crowdfunding doesn’t work.</h2>
<p>It just doesn’t.  You can’t get the top-tier guys to crowd-raise.  “What for? It’s just more complicated.”  If you can’t get the top-tier companies, you can’t get the companies that follow whatever top-tier companies do.  You end up with wanterpreneurs tricking Grandmas out of their paychecks. You’ve already lost.</p>

<p><img src="/images/grandma-paycheck.jpg" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<p>As a result, Crowdfunding-ish startups have been tiptoeing around the idea. <a href="http://angelist.com">AngelList</a> will make introductions but not facilitate the financial exchange. <a href="http://kickstarter.com">KickStarter</a> focuses on sponsorship rewards, but stays away from offering equity.  <a href="http://secondmarket.com">SecondMarket</a> works with later-stage companies and requires 6-figure minimums.</p>

<p><em>** Tis a shame. **</em> A world with crowd-funding for early stage startups would be pretty fun.  Imagine a company being able to reach out to its early users and saying “We’re starting to raise our next round of funding, and you’re welcome to be part of it.”</p>

<p>Nobody does that, though - the legal hassle of figuring out what it would take is too great and takes time away from what the company actually does.  Crowdfunding doesn’t work.</p>

<h2 id="except-that-it-does">Except that it does.</h2>
<p>Boris and Alex of <a href="http://thefundersclub.com">FundersClub</a> have found a way around the credibility problem, by having it to start with.  As part of the summer 2012 YCombinator class, the team has the implicit (and explicit) endorsement of Paul Graham, godfather of legit startups.  The two themselves have <a href="https://thefundersclub.com/site/about/">a rather impressive background</a> As a result, the <a href="https://thefundersclub.com/investments/">initial 5 companies</a> raising money on FundersClub are <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/08/01/eight-y-combinator-companies-to-watch/">some of the most interesting startups</a> of the group.</p>

<p><img src="/images/startuptoprow.png" />&lt;/img&gt;
<img src="/images/startupbottomrow.png" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<p>These are the cream of the crop.  Most are likely to be over-subscribed come Demo Day. As an investor, if you aren’t well connected to YCombinator (and probably even if you are), you’ll be stuck on the sidelines wishing you had a way into their seed rounds.</p>

<p>And with FundersClub, <strong>you do</strong>.  The two have spent several months figuring out how to make everything work legally.  Details are <a href="https://thefundersclub.com/site/howitworks/">on their website</a>, but briefly: when you invest in a company, you become a limited partner in a FundersClub investment fund which then in turn invests in the company.  As in traditional angel investments, accreditation is required (a minimum of $200k income or $1MM in assets).  No grandma paychecks allowed, no dependency on the JOBS act.</p>

<p>FundersClub has raised almost $1MM on behalf of its launch startups so far, and an investment (<a href="http://redeye.firstround.com/2012/08/welcome-fundersclub.html">and glowing review</a>) from First Round Capital and Josh Kopelman, respectively. Not bad for its first two weeks.</p>

<p>They’ve got a ways to go, but I for one am looking forward to being able to read a TechCrunch article about a startup and being able to click the “Invest” button at the bottom, adorned with a nice FC logo.</p>

<p>Good luck guys.</p>

          <p>A quick public service announcement about MongoDB, for those of us new to NoSQL land:</p>

<p>** By default, mongo will not let you know if a query that you ran failed miserably.**</p>

<p>On the bright side, you on longer need to wait for mongo to unblock for updates or inserts, which makes production code run quicker.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this also means you’re going to spend more time tracking down bugs that would have been caught by IntegrityErrors (or the equivalent) in good old SQLite.</p>

<p>** But I LIKE knowing about integrity errors**.  Me too, especially when testing locally.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s the fix</strong>: set <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Connections"><code>safe=True</code> in your Mongo connection object</a>.  In django non-rel, this means setting</p>

<pre><code>DATABASES = {
  'default': {
    ...
    'OPTIONS': {
      'safe': True
    },
  },
}
</code></pre>

<p>in settings.py.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p><img src="/images/Sidecar.png" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<p>A post about the service’s legal standing is probably worthwhile but not for me to write.  Should you use Sidecar?  Yes, if you’re looking for Uber-like service at Taxi-like prices and aren’t made uncomfortable by just how sketchy the whole thing feels.  The service is invite-only for now, but if you’re in SF: <a href="http://go.side.cr/oCz">here, have an invite (and 10 bucks)</a>.</p>

<h1 id="the-reputation-of-etas">The Reputation of ETAs</h1>
<p>I am fascinated by digital reputation systems, having focused on them in my senior thesis.</p>

<p><strong>Wait times matter</strong>.  In the taxi world (where a few of the drivers I’ve met come from), operators keep track of passengers who repeatedly order cabs and then don’t show up.  After a couple of no-shows, a phone number or address gets the equivalent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbanning">Hellbanned</a> - if they order a cab again, the operator will tell them the cab is on its way and then just not send anybody, leaving the passenger stranded.  It’s a cruel sort of system, but in lieu of a real-world consumer reputation system, it’s the only way I can think of for a cab company to punish poor behavior, like a waiter spitting in food.</p>

<p>In Sidecar’s reputation system, a passenger is rated 1-5 by drivers, but only once a ride is complete.  A cancelled ride, then, is not globally stored within Sidecar’s system, at least in a way visible to drivers.  The driver that was telling me this story compensates by “just remembering people” once they have skipped out on a ride or two.  In one case, he accepted a ride that claimed to be fifteen minutes away and proceeded to “walk into a deli, order a sandwich and some chips, make small-talk with the owner, and then eventually come pick the guy up.”</p>

<h1 id="the-solution">The Solution</h1>
<p>In Sidecar’s case, I propose a reasonably straightforward solution: give passengers a reasonable window within which to cancel (90 seconds? 120?).  If they don’t cancel, add the notification to their reputation system (late-cancelled 6% of Sidecars).  Let both parties know that this is criteria that drivers will see.  You’ll get fewer cancellation and fewer drivers having to “remember people” and punish them passive-aggressively.</p>

          <p>Whenever a friend visits our HQ, I proudly show off my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/WorkFit-S-Single-HD-Sit-Stand-Worstation/dp/B003WQ4GXQ/alexcom0ca-20">combination sit/stand desk</a>. Often, that results in an email asking where one buys such a thing. One buys such a thing on amazon.</p>

<h2 id="wait-why-a-standing-desk">Wait, why a standing desk?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/sitting-kills/">Sitting is killing you</a>, apparently. I don’t get as much exercise as I’d like now that I’m out of college, and at the least, standing for part of the day means I’m getting at least <em>some</em> exercise.</p>

<h2 id="the-options-i-explored">The options I explored</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There have been a few “<a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">Standing desk for cheap</a>” blog posts on Hacker News recently, but none of those allow me to easily move from sitting to standing. I could sit on a high stool, certainly, but that didn’t seem particularly ergonomic.  So, I went for the cheapest effective adjustable setup I could find.</li>
  <li>My stand is reasonably cheap ($370) and slides from sitting to standing via a gentle pull of the monitor up or down.  I couldn’t find anything else that offered a similar service for under $600 or so.</li>
  <li>There are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_pc?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=172282&amp;field-brandtextbin=Ergotron&amp;ref=alexcom0ca-20">several models of the Ergotron available</a>, depending on # and size of monitors you’d like, and whether you need a laptop at standing height as well.  One 30’’ was plenty for me, and came in at $370. Adding a second screen or a monitor would have bumped the price, but not by much.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-i-like-it">How I like it.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Installation was reasonably straightforward (took about a half an hour to build the thing).  The mount expects the back of your monitor to have certain dimensions in the mounting hinge. Check before buying.</li>
  <li>Overally, I’m pretty happy with the purchase, given the price point.</li>
  <li>I’d be lying if I say that I’ve gotten myself standing most of the time. I’m writing this sitting down.  But I definitely stand more than I would otherwise; it really depends on my energy on a daily basis.  I’ve definitely still got room for improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/WorkFit-S-Single-HD-Sit-Stand-Worstation/dp/B003WQ4GXQ/alexcom0ca-20"><img src="/images/standingdesk.jpg" />&lt;/img&gt;</a></p>

<p>So, that’s my setup.  Feel free to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/WorkFit-S-Single-HD-Sit-Stand-Worstation/dp/B003WQ4GXQ/alexcom0ca-20">get one for yourself</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: A friend of mine is running <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1886278358/ninja-standing-desk">a kickstarter for a portable standing desk</a>, for $150.  Seems pretty useful if you want to travel and have a standing work setup.</p>
