          <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; padding-left: 30px;">The flight landed at 11:18 pm. The first bags came out 40 minutes later. Mine came out just after midnight, so about 48 minutes after landing. People were pissed off, wondering (correctly) if anyone at all was dealing with the baggage. At one point a small purple bag came out and drifted around unclaimed and disappeared. Nothing else came for at least ten minutes after that.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re totally just fucking with us,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;the guy next to me said to my face.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t care at all.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>- Mike Arrington, via</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://uncrunched.com/2012/01/15/delta-flight-1642-sea-to-jfk-did-not-suck-nearly-as-much-as-i-thought-it-would/">http://uncrunched.com/2012/01/15/delta-flight-1642-sea-to-jfk-did-not-suck-nearly-as-much-as-i-thought-it-would/</a></p>
<p>This got me thinking.</p>
<p><img src="http://scrapetv.com/News/News%20Pages/Everyone%20Else/images-3/luggage-carousel-airport.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Why don't airlines or airports offer a service to just deliver your bags to your address later that day, without you waiting for it? &nbsp;I usually use a <a href="http://supershuttle.com">$10-$20 fixed-rate shuttle</a> to get home from the airport - why not do the same thing that you do for me, but to my bags?&nbsp;Offer it when checking bags online:</p>
<p><strong>[ ]</strong>&nbsp;- Deliver bags to your address in destination city and save time when you land - $19</p>
<p>They do this with lost baggage anyway. If somebody is picking you up from the airport, this eliminates a lot of uncertainty in when they should show up. Your customers have one less reason to dislike you. &nbsp;You can even make a deal with major hotels to subsidize those fees as an incentive to book a room there. &nbsp;In the long run, you can eliminate space at the terminal by getting rid of a number of carouselles. &nbsp;Apparently the service already exists in Japan.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>

          <p>I've known about&nbsp;<a href="http://kembrel.com">Kembrel</a>&nbsp;in a sort of by-the-way, there's-also-this-clothing-company sort of way for a few years now (I think I walked by a Kembrel physical sale last year), but never bothered to figure out what exactly it was that they did.</p>
<p>Until a couple of weeks ago, when&nbsp;<a href="http://meeteor.com">Meeteor</a>&nbsp;suggested I meet <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stephanjacob">Stephan</a>, one of the founders. So I did; here's his (and Kembrel's story).</p>
<p><img src="/images/IMG_20111220_003250.jpg" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Stephan from Kembrel" /></p>
<p><strong>Who is Stephan?</strong></p>
<div><a href="http://www.kembrel.com/theteam/">Stephan</a> is originally from Germany, where he served as a Special Forces Sniper for the German military. &nbsp;He's also a former Computer Science undergrad, having taken time off to work as a developer in NY, and a former consultant, and a recent Wharton MBA grad (which was how we sort-of-but-not-quite knew each other). &nbsp;In short: Stephan is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Most-Interesting-Man-In-The-World/90261849840">this guy</a>.</div>
<p><img src="/images/IMG_20111219_130654.jpg" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Stephan from Kembrel" /></p>
<p>Now he's the CEO (or Co-CEO, I'm not quite sure - whatever, he's one of the guys in charge) of Kembrel. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OK, so what's Kembrel?</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://kembrel.com">Kembrel</a> thesis, according to Stephan, is that college students are an appealing market for retailers (starting with fashion), an easy argument to make if you consider the future value of a wealthy customer whose tastes are being shaped today. &nbsp;College students are not, however, being well targeted by traditional fashion brands. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flash Sales</strong></p>
<p>Kembrel's initial solution to this was <a href="http://amandaword.hubpages.com/hub/What-is-Flash-Sale-The-New-Business-Mantra">flash sales</a>, a Gilt-style approach of offering deep discounts on a limited inventory of high-end merchandice in a limited time period. Clothing brands have unsold inventory that they need to sell otherwise and hopefully not hurt their brand by selling it at a low price. Flash sales, online and offline,give the brands an opportunity to both offload their excess inventory, while at the same time growing relationships with potential future customers.</p>
<p><img src="/images/IMG_20111219_131841.jpg" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Stephan from Kembrel" /></p>
<p>The sales were successful, and Kembrel is now popular in a number of larger college towns. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Customer Acquisition</strong></p>
<p>I've been thinking about customer acquisition lately, primarily because it's not obvious to me how to do it cheaply enough for a project I'm playing around with. &nbsp;There's no one silver bullet, according to Stephan, but one thing that has worked well consistenly has been partnering with other brands that target college students, from CollegeProwler to textbook rental websites. &nbsp;"CollegeProwler is almost an ideal partner," he explained. &nbsp;"It's students before they are even in college, to already get them thinking about Kembrel and make that association."</p>
<p><strong>Kembrel: Evolution</strong></p>
<p>As their popularity grew, explained Stephan, one concern with flash sales was the high fixed cost of the sale. To do a good job, the seller must synchronize the items being sold, get them shipped, take photos, write up a high-quality description, hire a designer and/or a director -- all that for a set of products that will be on the site for less than a week. &nbsp;Even Gilt Groupe, who are aiming to IPO in the next several years, is rumored not to be profitable based on their flash sales today. Scaling flash sales is hard.</p>
<p><img src="/images/IMG_20111219_131945.jpg" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Stephan from Kembrel" /></p>
<p>As a result, Kembrel has recently been diversifying, experimenting with a number of additional revenue models, from a straight-forward (though still discounted and targetted at college students) online shop, as well as considering physical locations, the first of which (at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1219+locust+st,+19104&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=39.95196,-75.194487&amp;sspn=0.009804,0.022724&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;hnear=1219+Locust+Walk,+Philadelphia,+Pennsylvania+19104&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">1219 Locust St</a>) I visited earlier.</p>
<p><img src="/images/kembrel.png" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Stephan from Kembrel" /></p>
<div>"The numbers for physical stores are really, really interesting," explained Stephan. &nbsp;"If we get somebody to walk inside, the odds of them buying something are absurdly high." &nbsp;The odds of them signing up online are significant as well. &nbsp;Online-to-offline and back to online commerce is a fun and nascent market, and Kembrel's current positioning and tech-savviness puts them in a place to be amongst the first to figure out how all this "get people online to come to your store, get people in your store to visit you online" stuff works.</div>
<p><img src="/images/flash-sale-anne-klein.jpg" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Stephan from Kembrel" /></p>
<p>Over the next several months, Stephen and the team are playing around with opening additional stores and measuring and learning as much as they can.</p>
<p><strong>Fin</strong></p>
<p>So, that's Kembrel. I understand what they do somewhat better now, and hopefully you do as well. Thanks for sitting down with me Stephen! Looking forward to seeing where you all take this company next. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>[Context: I'm one of the <a href="http://dinphil.com">Dining Philosophers</a>, the Computer Science Club at <a href="http://cis.upenn.edu">Penn</a>]</p>
<p><a href="http://interviewstreet.com">InterviewStreet</a>&nbsp;offered to sponsor a Study Break to help promote their upcoming <a href="http://codesprint.interviewstreet.com/recruit/challenges/">CodeSprint</a>. &nbsp;We contemplating doing a study break, but given that it's finals week and most people are working at home, we weren't sure what kind of turn-out we'd get for an event blocks away from where most people are.</p>
<p>We brainstormed for a little while about what to do instead, and came up with the idea of post-exam hot cocoa and doughnuts, which we've been serving as a surprise to a number of the larger CIS classes immediately outside their final. &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/images/photo_1.JPG" alt="Post-Finals Doughnuts and Hot Cocoa: This is obvious, but..." /></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The treats have been pretty well-received so far, resulting in people hanging around a little bit after the final, chatting with their TAs and one another and de-stressing in general. It's been great knowing that we've made finals a little bit nicer for people without forcing them to brave the cold and go somewhere for a study break. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, the initiative has been a win.</p>
<p><img src="/images/photo.JPG" alt="Post-Finals Doughnuts and Hot Cocoa: This is obvious, but..." /></p>
<p><strong>Best Practices</strong></p>
<p>Both for the purposes of future generations of Dining Philosophers and for other schools/clubs that may want to have a similar initiative, here's how we did it and what we learned. &nbsp;Some of this seems obvious, but helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setup Requirements: </strong>The food can be served with an hour's preparation and 2-3 people.</li>
<li><strong>Amount: </strong>We bought a jug of 'serves 10 cups' hot cocoa per 30-40 people and a doughnut per every other student. That ratio has been pretty good (we end up having a bit too much hot cocoa). &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Source: </strong>We've been buying from Dunkin Doughnuts rather than making our own Hot Cocoa, primarily because we've all got our own finals and CVS happened not to sell Hot Cocoa Mix when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>We're hovering just below $1/person/final, which works for us.</li>
<li><strong>Extra things you'll need that you don't think of until 20 minutes before:&nbsp;</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Knives</strong> (to cut the doughnuts in half before you serve them - just get plastic knives from somewhere,&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Napkins</strong> (make sure Dunkin gives you a few)</li>
<li><strong>Cups</strong> (Dunkin wanted to charge 25c/cup beyond 10 cups/jug, so we bought an extra 50 foam cups from CVS)</li>
<li><strong>A serving table</strong> - make sure to scout.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Alternatives:&nbsp;</strong>Some of these students are in &gt;1 of the classes we're hitting. &nbsp;We're thinking about switching it up to Hot Cider and Cookies, but that may take slightly more setup time. Ideas?<img src="/images/IMG_20111219_141416.jpg" alt="Post-Finals Doughnuts and Hot Cocoa: This is obvious, but..." /></li>
<li><strong>Coordination:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>We gave the TAs for the courses a heads-up (and asked them to help with logistics where needed) but didn't tell the professor until just before. &nbsp;Doughnuts feel more fun as a surprise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advertising:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>We stayed away from blatant advertising/taking credit, instead leaving subtle DP signs on the tables. &nbsp;Students are tired. This isn't a good time to throw leaflets at them about jobs.</li>
<li>Our plan for CodeSprint advertising is to (instead) email the CIS list-serv after finals and, as we remind students about CodeSprint, mention that their funding helped the doughhnut-and-hot-cocoa missions. &nbsp;This seemed like a pretty reasonable balance from our end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this stuff seems obvious, but I figured having best practices documented somewhere can't hurt.</p>
<p>Do comment/share if you do something similar at your school, have ideas or know that something like this is already being done somewhere. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>I gave a talk to the Wharton MBA E-club (I think?) earlier today about the difficulties of finding a technical co-founder. &nbsp;If I find the time, should probably turn this into a post, but for now, slides for the curious&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cheat Sheet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't spend your time looking for a technical co-founder, it's not an efficient use of your time. Instead, either: <ol>
<li>Learn to code     
<ul>
<li>Step needing to rely on others for execution</li>
<li>Meet technical people</li>
<li>Managing technical people becomes way easier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get an external team     
<ul>
<li>Don't offer equity</li>
<li>Agile:       
<ul>
<li>Weekly useful versions of the product</li>
<li>Pay weekly or hourly</li>
<li>A successful project doesn't 'end'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peanuts ==&gt; Monkeys</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid a 'tech play'     
<ul>
<li>Use white-labeled 'off the shelf' services where available</li>
<li>Fake your back-end: launch with only a pretty design, do hard work manually</li>
<li>License the tech from a company in a different vertical or geographic location</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Other takeaways:   
<ul>
<li>No NDAs</li>
<li>Get a technical advisor</li>
<li>Ask for advice, not employment</li>
<li>Co-founders are looking for competence and traction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Do you want to work on the CSS for the new page we&rsquo;re building?&rdquo;<br class="kix-line-break" /> </span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Will my code matter? <br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">One of the greatest joys of writing code is seeing your code ship and run in the wild; &nbsp;having users benefit from your design decisions feels great. If at all possible, make sure the code you will be writing does that. &nbsp;There are (at least) two reasons it may not: internal software or dead software:<p /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Internal: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Joel Spolsky described the </span><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Five Worlds of Software Development</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> almost a decade ago. &nbsp;Internal software doesn&rsquo;t have to be well written or engineered; it is typically written quickly and then left to (hopefully) still work. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a ton of &lsquo;internal&rsquo; or &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; software in academia and start-ups, and being able to be good at writing prototypes or good-enough software is a useful skill; just make sure that it&rsquo;s not all you ever do. &nbsp;At some point, make sure you get to work on code that needs to be great and not good enough; the amount you&rsquo;ll learn about software engineering and code readability is drastically different.<p /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Dead: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Most start-ups fail; your code may never see the light of day. &nbsp;Even at big companies, one of my friends from this summer had her project cancelled half way through her internship for unrelated reasons. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no clear way to keep your code from being part of vaporware; the best that I can recommend is to follow your gut: does the project you&rsquo;re considering joining seem like it&rsquo;s going to happen with or without you, or is everybody living on a prayer? &nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Who had my job before?<br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If your potential employer has had interns before, ask to talk to them about their experience for a reference check. &nbsp;If a potential employer is trying to dodge the question of past experience, that&rsquo;s a huge warning sign. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What are the expected outcomes of our work?<br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">You&rsquo;re looking for two types of outcomes: first, a particular set of skills through the job, and second, products that you can point to and say &ldquo;I built that,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I built this part of that.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><p />Skills: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What languages/frameworks/libraries are we going to be using? &nbsp;Do my mentor/boss/co-workers know these technologies well, or are we going to be picking a lot of them up as we go? There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with having to pick up something new, (in general, most every project you do will probably involve learning to use a new library of some sort) but having somebody on the team with domain-specific experience helps. &nbsp;Make sure you understand what technical skill-set in particular you are going to pick up, and then check that the technology you are learning is the kind being used at the places you want to work. &nbsp;As of the time of writing this, I&rsquo;d personally recommend picking up some of [Android/iOS development, Coffeescript, NodeJS Ruby, Ruby on Rails and/or Python]. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><p />Resume: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">One of your tasks as a CS graduate is to build a reasonable one-page resume/portfolio/github account showing off your credibility to potential employers for the summer or full-time. &nbsp;Be careful not to spend a year working on a project you can&rsquo;t ever talk about. &nbsp;<p />Ask: is this work I will be able to point to online? &nbsp;Will I be able to show the source code to potential employers? &nbsp;Are there any parts of my work that I can open source and stick on my github profile? The answer will be &lsquo;yes&rsquo; more often than you expect.</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What is the format/schedule for this job?<br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">There are a couple possible schedules for part-time jobs, from the very rigid (coming into the office on specific days and working set hours) to the very flexible (&ldquo;can you get this done by next week?&rdquo;). &nbsp;Which works best for you depends entirely on your schedule.<p />For me, having set hours for working part-time (but not full-time) has been a huge help. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got enough things going on between classes, work and extracurriculars that if I don&rsquo;t pencil in X hours a week for a particular activity, it&rsquo;s unlikely to get done. &nbsp;Working in a specific location also helps place me focus and helps avoid everyday distractions. &nbsp;Plus, if you&rsquo;re working for a start-up, they probably have free snacks. &nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of days for part-time work, I&rsquo;d recommend either one or two weeknights or most of Friday.<p />That said, everybody is different. &nbsp;It may be that you&rsquo;re able to get your work done in part-time chunks throughout the week. &nbsp;Regardless, make sure to speak to your potential employer about their propsed work schedule and try to understand their motivations. &nbsp;An answer like &ldquo;oh, we&rsquo;ll figure it out&rdquo; is a useful warning sign that the potential employer hasn&rsquo;t taken the time to think through how exactly your position will work.</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">How often will we have code reviews or pair programming?<br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If all you do is write code until it works and then submit it, there&rsquo;s no real mentorship going on; you&rsquo;re just a part-time employee. &nbsp;Mentorship means that you are getting feedback on your code consistently, if not for 100% of your check-ins then at least for a considerable fraction. Not every start-up can afford to do 100% code reviews the way that Microsoft, Google and Facebook can, but skimping on code reviews entirely is not acceptable.<p />Alternately, pair programming with your mentor means that you get to ask questions during your collaboration and absorb the kinds of little tips and tricks that are mostly passed down through apprenticeship. &nbsp;Best practices for pair programming as mentorship is worthy of its own blog post, but the one tip I&rsquo;d have is make sure the mentee has the keyboard for the vast majority of the time. <p />Code reviews or pair programming; potentially both. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re getting neither, you&rsquo;re not learning any more than you would be if you were working alone.</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">How will I be compensated for my work?<br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Programming work pays far better than most student on-campus jobs. Rates vary: I&rsquo;ve seen lab work at as little as $8/hour, internships can go between $12-25/hour and your pay as a freelancer is bounded only by your imagination and what the market will bear. &nbsp;<p />That said, at this stage in your career I&rsquo;d prioritize learning over compensation. &nbsp;Even at a relatively high salary, the fraction of your college loans that the internship will ever pay off is likely to be negligible. &nbsp;If your financial situation allows for it, I&rsquo;d pick at least your first or second part-time job entirely based on how much better of a developer the job will make you, and worry about the money later. &nbsp;Even if your sole focus is financial gain, a solid but unpaid internship pushes your lifetime value forward far more than a well-paying dead-end part-time job.<p />The difference between a great and a mediocre job/internship is huge. &nbsp;I learned more in 3 months at Facebook than I did in 3 years as a software engineer in the Israeli Defense Forces.<p />On the flip side, the benefit of a paying job means that the company is invested in you.<p /></span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What if they offer equity?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><br class="kix-line-break" />&ldquo;Whatever they offer you, equity or salary, ask for the other one&rdquo;<p />I can&rsquo;t find the source of this quote, but it reasonably sums up the best practice here. &nbsp;The start-up is making a choice about compensation: whatever thing (equity or cash) they don&rsquo;t give you is the thing they consider more valuable, and therefore the thing you should be more interested in obtaining. &nbsp;<p />I remember emailing a web-developer who was a mutual friend when I was starting out and offering to work together. &nbsp;All was well until I offered equity &lsquo;as compensation&rsquo;. &nbsp;I never heard back. Start-ups throwing around equity offers left and right in lieu of payment are a pretty good &lsquo;tell&rsquo; for amateurishness, especially given how favorable the current climate is to entrepreneurs wishing to raise early-stage capital.<p />In general, I think I agree with </span><a href="http://hackerengineer.net/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">my boss from this summer</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">, who basically considers the equity component of his compensation to be the equivalent of a lottery ticket - nice to have, but not to be depended on.<p />There&rsquo;s no hard and fast rule for whether to accept equity as early-stage payment or not, but &lsquo;no&rsquo; is a pretty reasonable default. &ldquo;Either pay me for my work or show me how I&rsquo;m going to get mentorship from this position,&rdquo; is not an unreasonable answer at all; don&rsquo;t be afraid to use it. &nbsp;For the less confrontational, a simple &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to work with you, but I&rsquo;m on financial aid and need a steady income&rdquo; is a completely reasonable excuse.</span></li>

<div style="background-color: transparent;"><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Maybe. &nbsp;&nbsp;Your goals for a part-time job should be to learn and to get paid, in that order. &nbsp;No technical people on staff means you&rsquo;re going to have to pick everything up yourself. &nbsp;None or barely any payment other than equity means that you are effectively doing the work pro-bono. &nbsp;The question then becomes: is this a better opportunity for me than </span></div>

</ul>
<br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The answer is a maybe. &nbsp;If you are particularly passionate about the idea, or like me have a hard time focusing on side-projects that don&rsquo;t have solid deadlines, and you can&rsquo;t find an alternate position that lets you learn the same technology but get paid/receive mentorship, go for it. &nbsp;</span><p /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">PPS.
