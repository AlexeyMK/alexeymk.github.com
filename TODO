Still to do (bugs/migrations/etc)
x TODO - include domain
x cloudflare the damn thing [nvm, let github deal with caching]
x Tags pages (/tag/hackathons) (todo, nicer things like tag headings, etc)
- Tags sidebar
- clean up tags
- paginate
- missing images
- read counts, as on Posterous
- images should work locally

Probably not until way later:
- host images on imgur
- paginate home page
