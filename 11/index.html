          <p>The <a href="http://www.whartoniteseekscodemonkey.com">quality of emails to the cis-ugrad list-serv</a> has received a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Caterina/status/33774039369519104">fair</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2182600">amount</a> of <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/code-this-for-me-wharton-douchiness-exploited-on-a-new-blog/">attention</a>&nbsp;recently. &nbsp;Making fun of clueless wanterpreneurs is good fun, but as many in the CS community have pointed out, it seems only fair to also educate and enlighten about what does and doesn't work. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/">Andrew Chen'</a>s recent <a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2011/02/05/stanford-cs-major-seeks-salesmarketing-monkey/">blog post</a>&nbsp;sums up quite well the crux of the irritation Engineers feel when getting emails like these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I&rsquo;m starting a online company that has to do with the fashion industry. I saw you through a friend we share in common; I hope this email is welcome.</p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3; text-align: left; text-indent: 1em; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br />This is our basic corporate structure:<br />1. CEO<br />2. CTO (Chief Technology Officer)<br />3. VP of Biz Dev/Sales<br />4. Chief Architect<br />5. Developers</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The irritation is basically this (via Andrew):</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard: The nerd perspective is, they don&rsquo;t need you.&nbsp;</strong>Much of the reason why it&rsquo;s insanely hard to find a really good technical cofounder is that the best ones really don&rsquo;t need you. Or at least they don&rsquo;t think they need you.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;">Because there&rsquo;s an illustrious track record of engineering-founded companies succeeding, spanning from HP to Facebook, there&rsquo;s a lot of datapoints that say that a 20-yo Stanford computer science major can do it himself, or at least with his other CS roommates.&nbsp;Similarly, the very best alums out of places like Facebook and Google have lots of access to capital, advice, and people- these are all recipes for making you (the biz founder) completely irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;">and &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;">Remember this:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 30px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px;">They are not the code monkey. You are the biz monkey.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;">That&rsquo;s just how it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, successful tech companies have been started by non-technical people (Apple, Dell, Zynga); yes, a number of the big successes (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo) were all started by engineers.&nbsp;I could go into length about this, but it's not particularly productive. &nbsp;For the moment, though: we (the cis-ugrad list-serv) are getting way more offers than the amount of time any one of us actually has. Naturally, that leads to being reasonably picky about the opportunities we end up pursuing. &nbsp;So:</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Sender of Amazing Opportunity,</p>
<p>Personally, I'm sure your idea is pretty cool and if you're not going to be successful with this one, you'll probably make out just fine in the end. The fact that you've found the list-serv and are contacting us is a pretty good show of initiative and just for that alone you have my respect. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that: this email is one of a ton that we're receiving: this is your shot to get us interested. You want to make sure you're doing it right; otherwise, your cool start-up or sweet job offer might just end up as unread junk literring our inboxes. That would suck. With your permission, I'd like to offer some advice on how to pitch your opportunity to CIS undergrads. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it short</strong>: If your email is longer than a paragraph or two, it's probably too long. Ever look at an unsolicited email on a list-serv and realize it's not worth reading because it would take too long? Exactly. &nbsp;As a rule of thumb, less than 200 words is probably a good idea.</li>
<li><strong>Make the offer right away: </strong>Your first or second sentence should, with as much clarity as possible, explain what the opportunity is and who it is targeting. People tend to be looking for a technical founder, part-time intern or employee, summer intern or full-time developer who may have a particular skill-set and is looking for some reasonable range of compensation. Are you looking for a first technical employee or do you already have a team? If I can tell the email targets people like me at the start, I'll keep reading it. If I get through the first paragraph and am still unsure what you're looking for, I'll probably keep moving.</li>
<li><strong>Be specific: </strong>There's nothing sillier than a stealth startup trying to recruit without saying what space it's in. I get that you know your idea is one-of-a-kind, but for us it's one of many that we'll read that day. <strong>If I don't know what your value proposition is, you don't have a value proposition. &nbsp;<p /></strong>This also applies to compensation: way too many emails explain that this is "something we can discuss" or that the compensation is "competitive." Competitive means different things to different people. While it makes perfect sense to offer more or less money or equity depending on the caliber and experience of the potential candidate, if you don't at least give a range, you're making it way too easy to ignore an offer that could have been a great fit. &nbsp;In case you're wondering what reasonable compensation might be: at least $15/hour is reasonably standard for this type of work.</li>
<li><strong>Be humble and straight-forward:</strong>&nbsp;I believe you; this is an awesome idea. Engineers are by and large friendly, no-bullshit people. &nbsp;Please don't throw words like synergy and competitive advantage around: they absolutely make sense in the business context and it's great that you're thinking about this stuff. As far as Engineers are concerned, though, this doesn't make you look impressive or competent; it makes you look like a suit who is too focused on business-y things to understand the technical challenges involved in the work. Nothing is more annoying than working for somebody who you feel doesn't understand your job.</li>
<li><strong>Proofread. &nbsp;</strong>Seriously, if you can't spel or have trouble with ALL CAPS, please ask a friend to proofread your email. Complete, grammatically correct sentences are a minimum requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Get your (technical) facts straight: </strong>Don't ask for somebody with at least 7 years of Ruby on Rails experience. If you're not sure why that's funny, look it up. &nbsp;There's no simpler way to get your email ignored than to show that you have no idea what work actually needs to be done. &nbsp;If you haven't invested the bare minimum of time required to do your research, that says something about your approach to technical work. Don't be a pointy-haired boss.</li>
<li><strong>Why should I work with you?&nbsp;</strong>The most painful class of emails we get is the "I've got a great idea, shouldn't be so hard, I just need somebody to do the web design in a week or so" email. First, engineering is not web design (though web design is an awesome and entirely non-trivial task). &nbsp;Second: it sounds like you're asking us to do something for you for free, just because it's an awesome idea. &nbsp;Fair enough; but why should I work on your awesome idea and not mine? &nbsp;There's one of several ways to convince us:                
<ul>
<li><strong>Money: </strong>If you're willing to pay at least a reasonable rate ($15-20+), that's fair. The idea or job might end up being terrible, but at least it won't be a waste of our time.</li>
<li><strong>Credibility: </strong>If you sold your last start-up for $XM dollars or you're well known to be technically-competent and willing to mentor people working for you, you're an appealing person to work with and can get away with a far smaller pay-scale or even get somebody to work for free as a learning experience or a way to get to know you. Ironically, people with credibility tend to be willing to pay for work, since they value their ideas enough to not want to easily give up equity in them. &nbsp;Having other people already on board also helps and is worth mentioning. Also, in case this isn't obvious: getting into Wharton or M&amp;T is not 'credibility'. &nbsp;We absolutely respect that it's a highly selective process and you're right to be proud of your accomplishment, but there's a lot of you. Sorry.</li>
<li><strong>Sheer Charm: </strong><a href="http://www.coursekit.com">Sometimes</a>, <a href="http://lemonlime.me/">non-technical</a> <a href="http://getmeep.com">people</a> get by on sheer charisma and persuasiveness. Congratulations to the few who can get away with it. &nbsp;This route has a reasonably low success rate; if you are going to try it, please at least make clear what you bring to the table. Andrew Chen <a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2011/02/05/stanford-cs-major-seeks-salesmarketing-monkey/">briefly discusses</a>&nbsp;what these might be - can you pick up design, or copy-writing, or user research? &nbsp;Can you test?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Avoid attachments. </strong>Don't send your offer as a doc or a pdf: send the offer right in the body. I'm not sure what percent of people open attachments from list-serves, but it's less than 100%.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yours,<br />- CS Majors @ Penn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>I spent Thurs-Sun of this past week in the Bay Area, interviewing for potential places to contribute to this summer and just generally meeting cool and interesting people. Let me just say: the Bay Area is awesome. &nbsp;The weather is warm. The people (that I met, at least) are incredibly open, willing to listen to some CS Junior's ideas about what they should do with their company and what the future of some technology might be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of the VC's and judges that helped out with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pennapps.com">PennApps</a>&nbsp;introduced me to potential employers; after that, one meeting kept leading to another; I spent about half the time interviewing and the other half setting up meetings for the next day. Now, I've been to San Francisco before; it's not (entirely) trivial to show up and meet people if you're just some dude, but from what I can tell introductions from respected people goes a ridiculously long way. &nbsp;<img src="/images/IMG_20110203_091826.jpg" alt="The Bay Area is Awesome" /></p>
<p>Serendipity goes a ridiculously long way; by sheer coincidence, I met <a href="http://twitter.com/caterina">Caterina Fake</a>&nbsp;and off-handedly mentioned <a href="http://whartoniteseekscodemonkey.tumblr.com">Whartonite Seeks Code Monkey</a>, a tumblr some CS guys had set up the week before in response to frustration at the cluelessness of many emails that came through our list-serv. Caterina tweeted the link<img src="/images/IMG_20110203_140352.jpg" alt="The Bay Area is Awesome" /></p>
<p>and we became a minor meme on the tech blogosphere, including reaching the top of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2182600">Hacker News</a>&nbsp;and resulting in an awesome article from <a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2011/02/05/stanford-cs-major-seeks-salesmarketing-monkey/">Andrew Chen</a>&nbsp;about how to add value as a business person. &nbsp;Eventually, even the <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/code-this-for-me-wharton-douchiness-exploited-on-a-new-blog/">local college blog</a>&nbsp;got into it. It's ironic that Penn CS ended up getting noticed more for the time we bitched about clueless Whartonites than when we got almost 100 students to <a href="http://www.pennapps.com/teams">spend a weekend hacking on awesome things</a>. &nbsp;Whatever; we'll get there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The point is, this whole thing got started because the Bay Area is awesome. I can't wait to go back.</p>

<p>I am contacting you on behalf of a next-generation Social Networking start-up that is looking for some ninja coders who know PHP and maybe some Python. &nbsp;<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The idea is, you can follow your friends and see what they are up to. &nbsp;Here's the twist, though - you can "check in" somewhere and then your friends can see and comment on it. It's also a Q&amp;A service.</span></p>
<p>The company was started by&nbsp;two Harvard students, a Psych and an Econ major. &nbsp;I don't want to get into too many financial details but we have a lot of really impressive high-profile investors interested in funding us. This is going to be a multi-billion dollar company. For sure.</p>
<p>We have gotten a ton of interest from people who want to work with us so you should be pretty good if you're going to apply. &nbsp;This is a <strong>ONCE IN A LIFETIME</strong> opportunity and if you miss out now you'll regret it forever, I'm telling you.</p>
<p>Interested? Apply <a href="http://www.facebook.com/careers/">here.</a></p>

<div><strong>Pros: </strong>You're work on a website you and your friends use on a daily basis (maybe? hopefully?). &nbsp;It feels good. &nbsp;You learn a ton about doing web development <em>reasonably </em>right in a production environment.</div>
<div><strong>Cons: </strong>The DP can take over your life. Also, the pay is terrible (either nothing or a couple of hundred bucks a month). &nbsp;Also, there's a good chance you'll have random business people who want you to do things like help create content for advertising.</div>
<div><strong>Counter-Cons: </strong>There's nothing wrong with things taking over your life, so long as they're good things. Also, the DP is a large and tight-knit community that puts together an award-winning newspaper. So there's that.</div>
<div><strong>Good for: </strong>Freshmen/sophomores and anybody looking to learn/get into web development but preferring a formal structure.</div>
<div><strong>How I know: </strong><a href="http://www.dangetelman.com/">Dan Getelman</a>&nbsp;ran the DP website starting spring of his freshman year. He turned out <a href="http://www.coursekit.com">all right.</a></div>

          <p><em>I'm taking Product Design with Karl Ulrich this semester. As part of the class, we have to come up with and outline 5 potential (physical) products targetted towards college students that are fairly simple and would retail for &lt;$50. &nbsp;I liked some of mine, so I figured I'd share them and see what people thought.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ideas:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>1. &nbsp;The Tech-Savvy Student's Padfolio</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Laptops and/or tablets are slowly gaining market share amongst students taking notes in class. &nbsp;A growing market opportunity exists in providing a note-taking tool that students can carry around as "the one low-tech thing I have in my backpack, in case I ever need to take notes or think on paper or if I need to take a hand-out." &nbsp;Today, I use a padfolio (<a href="http://git.to/padfolio)">http://git.to/padfolio)</a> for this purpose, but the padfolio is in no way custom-tailored to my needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I'd like to be able to do things like&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- work on both sides of my paper,&nbsp;<br />- easily collate (staple?) and tag/label notes or hand-outs, and<br />- optimize for an archiving process that takes into account my future likelihood of needing the particular set of notes or handout again.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>2. &nbsp;</strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>A bike lock that only locks 'the right way'</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As anybody who has ever had a bike stolen will tell you, more often than not, it's their own fault for not locking the bike correctly. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Standard bike locks sold today are a pain to use correctly. First, we have to find an appropriate place to lock the bike. Then it's a question of getting the frame and the wheel in while leaving enough space to attach the lock and turn the key. &nbsp;The one time I was in a rush and locked my bike wrong, I was left with this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2001/whats%20left.jpg" alt="" style="" /></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There's an opportunity in creating a bike lock that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Simply does not lock unless it's locked things correctly and<br />- Is quick &amp; effortless to install, but<br />- Is as safe as traditional locks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Anybody who has had a bike stolen (or anybody whose parents are worried about buying an expensive bike) wants to get a bike lock that only works 'the right way'.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>3. &nbsp;Cheap Dorm Room Whiteboard Pack</strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Every design/engineering student should have a whiteboard in their dorm room, but the current offerings are either expensive, poor quality or require nails or adhesive for installation, which is against most dorms' policies. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'Alternative' whiteboard solutions such as the <a href="http://www.whiteyboard.com">whiteyboard</a> tend to peal off and be hard to erase. &nbsp;Going to Loews or Home Depot, a properly-sized white-board may cost as much as $150.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Here's the opportunity: A mass-produced, reasonably-sized (3' by 4' or so) whiteboard/markers/eraser combination sold to college freshmen during move-in. &nbsp;The whiteboard comes with adhesive materials that have been proven to do no damage to the walls they are stuck on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. &nbsp;"Focus" headphones</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Consider noise-cancelling headphones that only have one button: to turn on the white noise. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As headphones meant to be worn when trying to focus on a particular task, these would serve two purposes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;- first, they eliminate external auditory interference<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- second, the design is distinctive (perhaps a big 'FOCUS' or an exclamation mark on the back) and makes it clear to others in the room that the person wearing the headphones is not to be disturbed; they are deeply focused on something important.</p>
<p><strong>5. "Who's around" roommate checkin board</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you knew which of your house-mates was around at any given point, you'd know if anybody was up for dinner or perhaps whether you and your new friend would need to be discreet as you made your way to your room. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A simple board with 5-10 switches, marked 'Home' and 'Away' mounted on the back of the front door gives house-mates a simple way to communicate to their neighbors' current status. The convenient location makes updating painless and near-automatic as roommates take of their jackets or shoes. &nbsp;A small attached whiteboard lets roommates be more particular about their status (IE, "do not disurb, midterm tomorrow").</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think? Are any of these worth pursuing?</p>
