<div><strong>Pros: </strong>You're work on a website you and your friends use on a daily basis (maybe? hopefully?). &nbsp;It feels good. &nbsp;You learn a ton about doing web development <em>reasonably </em>right in a production environment.</div>
<div><strong>Cons: </strong>The DP can take over your life. Also, the pay is terrible (either nothing or a couple of hundred bucks a month). &nbsp;Also, there's a good chance you'll have random business people who want you to do things like help create content for advertising.</div>
<div><strong>Counter-Cons: </strong>There's nothing wrong with things taking over your life, so long as they're good things. Also, the DP is a large and tight-knit community that puts together an award-winning newspaper. So there's that.</div>
<div><strong>Good for: </strong>Freshmen/sophomores and anybody looking to learn/get into web development but preferring a formal structure.</div>
<div><strong>How I know: </strong><a href="http://www.dangetelman.com/">Dan Getelman</a>&nbsp;ran the DP website starting spring of his freshman year. He turned out <a href="http://www.coursekit.com">all right.</a></div>

          <p><em>I'm taking Product Design with Karl Ulrich this semester. As part of the class, we have to come up with and outline 5 potential (physical) products targetted towards college students that are fairly simple and would retail for &lt;$50. &nbsp;I liked some of mine, so I figured I'd share them and see what people thought.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ideas:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>1. &nbsp;The Tech-Savvy Student's Padfolio</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Laptops and/or tablets are slowly gaining market share amongst students taking notes in class. &nbsp;A growing market opportunity exists in providing a note-taking tool that students can carry around as "the one low-tech thing I have in my backpack, in case I ever need to take notes or think on paper or if I need to take a hand-out." &nbsp;Today, I use a padfolio (<a href="http://git.to/padfolio)">http://git.to/padfolio)</a> for this purpose, but the padfolio is in no way custom-tailored to my needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I'd like to be able to do things like&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- work on both sides of my paper,&nbsp;<br />- easily collate (staple?) and tag/label notes or hand-outs, and<br />- optimize for an archiving process that takes into account my future likelihood of needing the particular set of notes or handout again.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>2. &nbsp;</strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>A bike lock that only locks 'the right way'</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As anybody who has ever had a bike stolen will tell you, more often than not, it's their own fault for not locking the bike correctly. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Standard bike locks sold today are a pain to use correctly. First, we have to find an appropriate place to lock the bike. Then it's a question of getting the frame and the wheel in while leaving enough space to attach the lock and turn the key. &nbsp;The one time I was in a rush and locked my bike wrong, I was left with this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2001/whats%20left.jpg" alt="" style="" /></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There's an opportunity in creating a bike lock that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Simply does not lock unless it's locked things correctly and<br />- Is quick &amp; effortless to install, but<br />- Is as safe as traditional locks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Anybody who has had a bike stolen (or anybody whose parents are worried about buying an expensive bike) wants to get a bike lock that only works 'the right way'.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>3. &nbsp;Cheap Dorm Room Whiteboard Pack</strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Every design/engineering student should have a whiteboard in their dorm room, but the current offerings are either expensive, poor quality or require nails or adhesive for installation, which is against most dorms' policies. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">'Alternative' whiteboard solutions such as the <a href="http://www.whiteyboard.com">whiteyboard</a> tend to peal off and be hard to erase. &nbsp;Going to Loews or Home Depot, a properly-sized white-board may cost as much as $150.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Here's the opportunity: A mass-produced, reasonably-sized (3' by 4' or so) whiteboard/markers/eraser combination sold to college freshmen during move-in. &nbsp;The whiteboard comes with adhesive materials that have been proven to do no damage to the walls they are stuck on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. &nbsp;"Focus" headphones</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Consider noise-cancelling headphones that only have one button: to turn on the white noise. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As headphones meant to be worn when trying to focus on a particular task, these would serve two purposes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;- first, they eliminate external auditory interference<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- second, the design is distinctive (perhaps a big 'FOCUS' or an exclamation mark on the back) and makes it clear to others in the room that the person wearing the headphones is not to be disturbed; they are deeply focused on something important.</p>
<p><strong>5. "Who's around" roommate checkin board</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you knew which of your house-mates was around at any given point, you'd know if anybody was up for dinner or perhaps whether you and your new friend would need to be discreet as you made your way to your room. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A simple board with 5-10 switches, marked 'Home' and 'Away' mounted on the back of the front door gives house-mates a simple way to communicate to their neighbors' current status. The convenient location makes updating painless and near-automatic as roommates take of their jackets or shoes. &nbsp;A small attached whiteboard lets roommates be more particular about their status (IE, "do not disurb, midterm tomorrow").</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think? Are any of these worth pursuing?</p>

          <p>I've been using tungle.me for about a year now. The service lets users post their availability publicly (tungle.me/Alexey), letting users send emails like "Sure, let's get coffee next week. My availability's at tungle.me/Alexey; let me know what works for you." &nbsp;Availability data is taken from users' Google calendars; if you're like me and meticulously schedule your day on GCal, the remaining 'empty' slots coincide quite reasonably with times I'm available. Visitors to a tungle.me page also have the option to schedule a meeting directly on the page.</p>
<p><img src="http://content.screencast.com/users/AlexeyMK/folders/Jing/media/a004fabe-162f-43ce-ab1a-770d7ddcdaa8/tungle.me.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Review<br /></strong>All in all, the service is great. It solves so many 2-way scheduling problems that I ended up having my tungle.me page as the only thing in my email signature. The site still has a number of kinks - schedulers are forced to offer multiple meeting times, for example, and a failure to synchronize with GCal will result in me being listed as 'available' when I'm not). &nbsp;A couple of extra features would be nice, too; for example, tungle.me/Alexey/30-minutes-next-week should be a link I can send somebody that would limit potential meeting times to available 30-minute blocks next week. Still, tungle.me solves a time-consuming pain point, so I use it.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that what I've seen of the site's growth has been entirely viral. The company is based in Montreal; I found out about it when I got a Skype meeting invite through tungle.me. &nbsp;Since then, several friends have adopted the service. &nbsp;Tungle.me is viral.</p>
<p><strong>Reaction<br /></strong>Mostly, people tend to react positively or neutrally to my sending out tungle.me links. &nbsp;Less tech-savvy users tend to continue to schedule meetings over email, (How about 6PM on Thursday? Your tungle.me says you're free) though I do get the occasional tungle-direct invite as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A more interesting (and rarer) response, however, has been to refuse to use the service and instead insist on coordinating schedules over email. &nbsp;Partly, this could be a direct Luddite response, a la "I don't trust new apps," (not that any of a user's data is being accessed or used). &nbsp;A more common issue is that of social status. Saying "You, go pick a meeting time for us" can be interpreted in two ways: either as "I really want to meet with you, pick any time you're free," or "Go talk to my digital secretary about scheduling a meeting; I don't deal with little things like that personally." &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second interpretation pops up in sitautions when you try to ask somebody for a meeting and then ask them to schedule it. &nbsp;The gut reaction is often "wait, you want this meeting - why am I doing the scheduling?" &nbsp;Rationally, using tungle.me is time-saving for both parties, but it's hard to explain that to somebody you're working your ass off trying to get a meeting with. &nbsp;Social dynamics are hard; norms may adjust to be more tungle.me friendly in the future, or tungle.me might find ways to make it look like the initiative is being taken by the meeting proposer.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br /></strong>tungle.me is well positioned amongst early adopters, viral, and useful. &nbsp;As it expands beyond early adopters, I think it's going to be part of the future of scheduling.</p>
<p>What do you think - am I being a douche by asking contacts to check out my availability on tungle.me instead of taking the time to write it in an email?</p>
<p><em>Note: Multi-person meeting schedulers (scheduleonce/when2meet/doodle) are interesting too and probably deserve a post of their own.&nbsp;</em></p>

          <p>If you look at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexeymk">my LinkedIn account</a>, it would seem like I'm not a particularly active user; I've only got&nbsp;<del>79</del> 74 connections and no picture. &nbsp;Here's the thing: I'm not sure if I'm using it right.</p>
<p>My LinkedIn 'friending' policy is simple: I'll accept a connection if the person offering it is somebody who I would feel comfortable recommending if somebody asked "hey, do you know any good ____?" &nbsp;Unless I've worked with somebody, am personally friends with them, or have had the kind of conversation where I can sort of smell competence, I probably am not comfortable being a LinkedIn connection of theirs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a reasonably good chance that I'm wrong. My friend Yujin, an MBA who now does bizdev for Venture Capital, says I should be friending most business connections I make and that this is the norm for LinkedIn. &nbsp;As a result, Yujin's got <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/yujinchung">500+ connections</a>&nbsp;and is the ultimate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connector_(social)">connector</a>. &nbsp;And he rocks it. &nbsp;Still, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of being a connection (and, effectively, agreeing to be a reference for) somebody who I don't yet trust.</p>
<p><img src="/images/invite_to_connect_on_linkedin.png" alt="Loose Ties Link Ships:  Friending norms on LinkedIn" /></p>
<p>LinkedIn seems to at least somewhat agree with me on this; when I try to add a new contact, it warns me to add only 'people you know well and who know you.' &nbsp;And yet,&nbsp;I've had a number of (reasonably respectable) random people add me as a LinkedIn connection as a way to get an introduction. &nbsp;There's a reasonable chance that this is because they can't find my email address and LinkedIn tries to make money by offering 'direct contact via inMail' as a premium feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One solution to the whole friending strong versus weak ties (which, esp. when compared to Facebook's or Twitter's, probably deserves its own post) is LinkedIn's endorsements feature. &nbsp;If you really want to show that you trust somebody, endorse them by writing a positive recommendation. &nbsp;Still, I can't bring myself to 'accept' people I would not (yet) comfortable hiring or working for. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a social rolodex where I can can add anybody I've ever met, without any implied friendship or any fears of references or privacy. &nbsp;This is <em>almost</em>&nbsp;what Twitter is, except that I'm not particularly interested in what random people I've met once have had for lunch. &nbsp;What I would (ideally) like is a social, digital rolodex, sorted by time and (perhaps) with some sort of tagging features, so I can mark people by the things we share in common.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm just old-fashioned. &nbsp;What are your LinkedIn 'connection' policies?</p>

          <p><em>I gave a talk at <a href="http://www.barcampphilly.org/">BarCamp Philly</a>&nbsp;a couple of months back about best practices in hiring technical (mostly CS) interns from Penn. I've since distilled the talk into bitesize pieces and plan to publish its remnants here, starting with the Who and the Where. &nbsp;If we haven't met, I'm a CS Junior @ Penn.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://content.screencast.com/users/AlexeyMK/folders/Jing/media/a95a90bf-fac9-4255-a258-8580865dcadd/2010-12-28_1750.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>You've figured that, for whatever reason, you want to recruit some Engineering/CS talent from Penn to work with you on something, either in an internship or a partnership capacity. That's cool. We'll re-examine the assumption that a Penn CS student is who you really need in a later post, but let's continue on for now.</p>
<p>Unless you come from Penn Engineering and/or have a CS background, though, it's not entirely clear what you should be doing to reach out. Here's what you need to know:</p>
<p><strong> Who we are</strong></p>
<p>As everywhere, the culture varies and stereotypes aren't particularly welcome. We've got <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~thetatau/">frats</a>, we've got gamers, we've got <a href="http://upenn.siggraph.org/games.html">game makers</a>, we've got <a href="http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/">the kind of science and technology geeks who decided it might be fun to launch a blimp</a>, we've got all kinds. We're engineers. It's a good mix.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://content.screencast.com/users/AlexeyMK/folders/Jing/media/3bbfe2ec-aba2-445a-b559-33a82428dc06/2010-12-28_1802.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In terms of your competition, here's a rough estimate as to the type of work students are looking for. Google doesn't just mean Google in this case, it means large, successful engineering-driven tech company.</p>
<p>Pixar's representation is a result of the <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd/">Digital Media Design</a> program. DMD students are known for (at least to me) as being able to draw and handle graphics, while at the same time being able to out-code you any day. They're kind of impressive.</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs/financial side of the pie chart is a result of Wharton School/New York influence. We have a disproportionally large amount of Wharton dual-degree/<a href="http://www.upenn.edu/fisher/">M&amp;T</a>&nbsp;students studying things like Finance &amp; CS, who end up going to work for investment banks and hedge funds. Since a lot of these financial companies are on campus, they end up recruiting from CS reasonably heavily. I'm doing my best to withhold judgement here.</p>
<p>Finally, the 'start my own company' group is a small but growing one, bolstered by recent successes like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/03/google-confirms-invite-media/">Invite Media</a> and <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/entrepreneurship/2010/12/02/ebay-buys-local-shopping-site-milo">Milo</a>, two recent Penn CS start-ups. We're growing. This is a good time to be at Penn.</p>
<p>In appealing to Penn CS students, try to figure out whether you fit into any of these categories reasonably well, since these are going to affect who and how you pitch your proposed employment.</p>
<p><strong>How to reach us</strong></p>
<p>From broad to personal, here's a list of ways to reach out to students studying CS@Penn:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/pennlink_employers.html">PennLink</a>&nbsp;is Penn's official on-campus recruiting website. I can't vouch for it, though: my only experience with PennLink was when looking for a summer internship my Sophomore year. Back then, most of the jobs available seemed generic (consulting, etc) and the technical jobs were mainly by large corporations that I wasn't interested in. I'm not sure how well other CS majors have fared on PennLink, though.</li>
<li><a href="http://pennstudentdesign.com/">Penn Student Design</a> is an internal 'web design' guild run largely out of DMD. If you're looking to have a freelancer-type arrangement help you make your website look impressive, contacting PSD makes a lot of sense.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jackie/">Jackie Caliman</a>&nbsp;is the Associate Director for Advising of the undergraduate CS department. Let me digress and say that there are no words to describe the sheer awesomeness that is Jackie. &nbsp;If every organization has a person behind the scenes keeping the whole thing together; for us, that's Jackie Calman. &nbsp;<br />The reason that's relevant is because Jackie sends out CS list-serv emails on behalf of potential employers. Most of the interesting job opportunities I end up seeing come from that list-serv; I'd recommend reaching out to Jackie to see if she'll forward your email on. &nbsp;That said, we get a lot of reasonably painful-to-read emails. I'll discuss exactly how to put together a good pitch to a CS student in a later post.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pennapps.com">PennApps.com</a>&nbsp;[shameless plug] is a twice-yearly, student-run weekend-long hackathon that brings out a lot of the top 'I can make something really fast' hacker-types out. If you can afford it, (IE, if you're funded) you should sponsor - we do our best to help sponsors meet and recruit top participants for internships. If not, you should show up to demo session and see what people are up to.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pennlaunch.com">PennLaunch</a>&nbsp;is a sort of internal LinkedIn for Penn, focusing on specific projects people are working on. Run by the <a href="http://www.tech-house.upenn.edu/">Weiss Tech House</a>, the site hasn't reached it's potential yet (IE, not enough engineers are on it), but it's getting there.</li>
<li><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dFlZWlJxSWNIYXJHUFd6Q1ZtbmpZVEE6MQ">Penn StartupConnect</a> and <a href="http://startupspeeddating.weebly.com/">Startup Speed Dating</a> are twice-yearly events run by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/joshwais">Josh Wais</a> and <a href="http://blog.careercup.com/">Gayle Laakhman</a>, respectively. The two use slightly different formats, but the idea is the same: get people from the business/tech side of things into the same room and let them take it from there. Watch out for these if you're in the Philly area.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/departmental/faculty/">Professors </a>are often worth meeting with, especially if you've figured out what particular field (Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, etc) you need talent in. &nbsp;If they like you, they may just introduce you to some of their top students.</li>
<li>Last, there's always old-school networking. Ask around - see who you know who can introduce you to somebody who is part of the community. [Another shameless plug] I'll typically have lunch with anybody interesting that offers to the detriment of work that needs to be done.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>That's +/- it. Let me know if you have any questions and if there's anything in particular I should address in future posts.</p>
