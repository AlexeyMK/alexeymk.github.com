Whenever a friend visits our HQ, I proudly show off my [combination sit/stand desk](http://www.amazon.com/WorkFit-S-Single-HD-Sit-Stand-Worstation/dp/B003WQ4GXQ/alexcom0ca-20). Often, that results in an email asking where one buys such a thing. One buys such a thing on amazon.

The options I explored
----------------------
- There have been a few "[Standing desk for cheap](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html)" blog posts on Hacker News recently, but none of those allow me to easily move from sitting to standing. I could sit on a high stool, certainly, but that didn't seem particularly ergonomic.  So, I went for the cheapest effective adjustable setup I could find.
- My stand is reasonably cheap ($370) and slides from sitting to standing via a gentle pull of the monitor up or down.  I couldn't find anything else that offered a similar service for under $600 or so.
- There are [several models of the Ergotron available](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_pc?_encoding=UTF8&node=172282&field-brandtextbin=Ergotron&ref=alexcom0ca-20), depending on # and size of monitors you'd like, and whether you need a laptop at standing height as well.  One 30'' was plenty for me, and came in at $370. Adding a second screen or a monitor would have bumped the price, but not by much.

How I like it.
-------------
- Installation was reasonably straightforward (took about a half an hour to build the thing).  The mount expects the back of your monitor to have certain dimensions in the mounting hinge. Check before buying.
- Overally, I'm pretty happy with the purchase, given the price point.
- I'd be lying if I say that I've gotten myself standing most of the time. I'm writing this sitting down.  But I definitely stand more than I would otherwise; it really depends on my energy on a daily basis.  I've definitely still got room for improvement.

So, that's my setup.  Feel free to [get one for yourself](http://www.amazon.com/WorkFit-S-Single-HD-Sit-Stand-Worstation/dp/B003WQ4GXQ/alexcom0ca-20).

**PS**: A friend of mine is running [a kickstarter for a portable standing desk](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1886278358/ninja-standing-desk), for $150.  Seems pretty useful if you want to travel and have a standing work setup.
