<p>Whoa. &nbsp;Thanks for all the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2477586">attention </a>and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/gw0y3/dear_dr_stallman_an_open_letter/">feedback</a>, <a href="http://backtweets.com/search?q=alexeymk.com%2Fdear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter&amp;ref=p1">everybody</a>! In case you're curious: I ended up emailing the letter to RMS and got a reply earlier today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I am skeptical of advice from people who disagree with what I stand for.</span></p>
<p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="color: #888888;">--<br />Dr Richard Stallman</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, commenters seem to have had <a href="http://socialmention.com/search?q=alexeymk&amp;t=all&amp;btnG=Search">fairly positive</a>&nbsp;things to say, but a number ended up arguing against points I wasn't making. &nbsp;To be clear: I don't think RMS is wrong to argue for Free Software, or that he should somehow moderate his position; I just don't think mentioning 9/11 or the Swindle is particularly helpful to the FSF cause. &nbsp;If you haven't yet, check out the <a href="http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~pengp/Files/Stallman/">recording</a>&nbsp;of his talk and judge for yourself.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm incredibly grateful for all of the contributions RMS has and continues to make, but I don't think RMS (or anybody) is beyond criticism.&nbsp;To equate criticism of a tactic with criticism of an ultimate goal does not seem to be an effective way to encourage feedback or open discussion. &nbsp;I'd love to see an FSF which takes itself seriously through its spokespeople and campaigns, because I think a cohesive and credible argument from the FSF is an important part of the discussion about the future of technology's role in society.</p>
<p>Alright, that's enough buzzwords for one paragraph. Thanks for taking the time to discuss, everybody.</p>
<p>[Edit: here's <a href="http://alexeymk.com/dear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter">the original letter</a>]</p>
