          <p>Two steps forward, two steps back: 2016 in review.</p>

<p>I spent most of 2015 living out of a carry-on bag, traveling from Estonia and Berlin to Tokyo and Taipei helping run trips for, and building, Hacker Paradise.</p>

<p>It was great. That said, one year was plenty. After getting an H1-B visa, I moved back to the Bay Area in April 2016 and decided to get a job.</p>

<p>2015 and 2016 ended up as stark contrasts; here's how becoming sedentary and employed has turned out so far, relative to expectations.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>Basically, stability.</p>

<h3>Engaged</h3>

<p>My partner and I are (at long last) engaged! After 5 years of being together, we're back to living together and have a place in Bernal Heights that feels like our own. We're so domestic we even got an Ikea couch and a Casper-esque mattress. There's something very warm and comforting in having a good sense of whom you are going to spend the rest of your life with. Mari is like an anchor that  makes disruption in other parts of your life easier to handle.</p>

<h3>Friendship &amp; Community</h3>

<p>It's also been rewarding to be able to engage and re-engage in meaningful friendships. One of the toughest parts of traveling with Hacker Paradise had been meeting new people every month (great people, mind you) and forging friendships with them. At some point the task becomes exhausting and you yearn for the comfort of existing friendships where you don't need to provide context for your jokes and are largely accepted, quirks and all.</p>

<p>Part of the motivation for coming back was to return to my existing friends and spend more time with them, without the fear that in a few weeks we're going to go our own ways. I'm still not 100% back to feeling integrated or satisfied with the depth of my relationships, but compared to full-time travel the improvement has been remarkable and the last few months of 2016 felt much better than when we had just moved back.</p>

<h3>J.O.B.</h3>

<p>After a brief stint at Sprig, I ended up joining Opendoor in September. Part of the motivation of being an employee was to have co-workers I would learn from &amp; enjoy working with. This came true.  Another part, which I was more suprised to learn, was that "Growth Engineering" - a term I would have thought ridiculous back in college, and as a sell-out-sort-of-a-thing-to-do, is actually quite engaging and satisfying. I'm very pleased to have discovered a role outside of doing pure engineering or product work where interdisciplinary skills are such a strong asset. It feels like I'm doing behavioral economics research again, but with higher stakes. I'm very greatful to Remi Gabillet, my manager from Sprig, for seeing that this kind of role would fit well for me.</p>

<p>Opendoor has easily met expectations in terms of the company's growth, my faith in management and the executive team, and my ability to have an impact as an individual contributor joining a 150+ person company.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>There's no better crutch for procrastination then employment.  A problem that I see a lot of engineers and founders in tech can have is this mission-at-all-costs mentality; like political operatives on a critical campaign or soldiers in the middle of a war, it's easy to say "this thing I'm part of is more important. I can postpone [personal thing that I should get done] for now, because if we win we can always deal with it later." And then the  mission comes to an end and we're sort of stuck figuring out that we've got to find a way to do our own laundry and maybe go to the gym more often and make sure we have the proper healthcare.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for deciding to get a job rather than starting another company was that I could use the superior work-life balance to get the rest of my shit in order, and pull back no the mission mentality.</p>

<p>That hasn't really happened. It did, a little bit, at Sprig. But at Opendoor, working harder, staying longer, has been too easy and too rewarding to be easily avoided, and I fall back into using mission excuses.</p>

<p>As a result, I've definitely gained some weight (something that did not happen while traveling and eating at restaurants full-time for a year and a half). I've ignored a doctor's note to start watching my cholestorol. I missed a dentist appointment. I bike to work but don't have a regular gym schedule.</p>

<p>I also have yet to deal with setting up some nuances relating to my Health Savings Account. I have an accident claim from a rental car that got broken into that is still open since September.</p>

<p>I planned to set concrete mental health goals around building perseverance and good habits, and start seeing a therapist regularly. That hasn't happened.</p>

<p>Instead, I've reverted to occassionally staying up way later than I should and then being less productive at work the next day - essentially a high-school version of myself but with more severe impact to my productivity, given I'm not sixteen anymore.</p>

<p>I consume more alcohol on a weekly basis than I did while traveling (San Francisco, you cray!).  I spend more on rent than I used to on everything.</p>

<p>Basically I find myself easily falling into many of the typical priveleged-engineer-at-legit-startup-in-bay-area traps. It's funny but also a little dissapointing, since I was well aware of (and caution others) against this kind of self-neglect. It would be more productive to be making <em>new</em> mistakes.</p>

<h2>All in all</h2>

<p>Some good, some bad.  As far as new year's resolutions go, I'm going to need to make sure to be hitting my original goals.</p>

<h2>2017 Goals:</h2>

<p><em>Sleep</em> Maintain a healthy sleep schedule (7+ hours of sleep and in bed by 1AM, 95% of the days of the year)
<em>Exercise</em> Do something (bouldering, gym, or new sports) 3+ days a week, 95% of weeks except vacation. Reach and maintain target weight of around 10 pounds less than Jan 1st, 2016.
<em>Mental Health</em> Build mental resilience (either pick a book or hire a therapist by Jan 30; create a growth plan; follow said plan).
<em>Physical Health</em>
- Schedule &amp; attend follow-up physical by Jan 30; follow recommendations.
- Schedule &amp; attend dentist appointment by Feb 30.
<em>Writing (AKA, other interests)</em>
- Begin
- Publish a 500+ word piece once a month, including receiving quality feedback from friends.</p>
