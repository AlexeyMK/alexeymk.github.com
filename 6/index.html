          <p>I may be a bit late to the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> party, but with Posterous being acquired by twitter a few months ago, I figured why not try it out. Two weekends later I’ve migrated enough that I’m comfortable shipping, though I imagine a bunch of silly bugs will remain. Please <a href="mailto:alexey-at-alexeymk.com">email me</a> with any issues you find, and I’ll get to them when I can.</p>

<p>In the meantime…</p>

<h4 id="moving-from-posterous-to-jekyll-what-you-need-to-know">Moving from Posterous to Jekyll: What you need to know.</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a></strong> is a static site generator created by GitHub for GitHub Pages.  It is rather extensible, so people have built things like <a href="http://str8.to/jekyll-boostrap">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://str8.to/jekyll-octopress">Octopress</a> on top of it.  I sort of half-used the former (adapted a theme) and didn’t know about the latter until it was too late.  Maybe/probably use Octopress if you go this route.</li>
  <li><strong>Migrating from Posterous</strong> kinda-sorta works.  The migrator that includes images/permalinks is <a href="https://github.com/pepijndevos/jekyll/blob/patch-1/lib/jekyll/migrators/posterous.rb">on github here</a>.  Some ruby required.  Here’s <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyMK/alexeymk.github.com/blob/master/posterous_import.rb">my hacky version</a>, with a couple of updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Comments</strong> I haven’t moved mine yet but a <a href="http://blog.jrmoran.com/blog/2012/01/31/importing-posterous-comments-into-disqus/">guide to move posterous comments to disqus</a> is available.  The decision to have comments (even moderated ones) is not one I’ve made yet. We’ll see.</li>
  <li><strong>RSS</strong> Here’s the <a href="http://recursive-design.com/blog/2010/09/14/integrating-jekyll-with-feedburner/">jekyll+feedburner guide</a></li>
  <li><strong>Developing Locally</strong> I used <a href="https://github.com/therabidbanana/guard-jekyll">guard to auto re-generate pages</a> as I was iterating on the CSS hackery.  Pretty useful, especially if you’re already reasonably comfortable with guard.</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting</strong> GitHub Pages will host for you at yourusername.github.com + let you host on your domain <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/blog/github-pages-email/">if you add a CNAME to your distribution</a>.  I’m about to try it.  Fingers crossed.  Also, I don’t know how much I trust GitHub to be so generous in the long run, but my next migration is going to be far less painful - “it’s just static content”.  <strong>Note</strong>: I was worried about where to stick draft posts, since the repo needs to be public, and my solution was to have both a public and a private repository, so releasing is “git commit -a &amp;&amp; git push public master.”</li>
  <li><strong>Markdown</strong> I admit I’m not too experienced with Markdown. Here’s <a href="http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet">my cheatsheet</a>.</li>

          <p>I tried <a href="http://iamexec.com">Exec</a>&nbsp;for the first time today. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://iamexec.com/r/efb7478514db45c946c2aa7157f53e1f"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1lP6J.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR - don't half-ass the task description/understanding what you actually need.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motivation:<br /></strong>I had found a blog post with a ton of discussion online that had some great comments showing a deep understanding of the material. &nbsp;"These people are awesome," I thought. "Let's see who among them we could hire!".</p>
<p>Huzzah, finally a chance to try TaskRabbit andExec.</p>
<p><strong>My description:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>I'm looking for contact info for a few (about 10-15) posters from a couple of blog posts (links below)</span></p>
<p><span>Result: I'd like an excel spreadsheet that looks like this, for every commenter that seems to be well-received. &nbsp;</span><span style="">You may need to start with the Username and google for all of their other info.</span></p>
<p><span>Spreadsheet format:</span><br /><span>Username | What They Said (+Link) | Contact Info (email?) | Github | Personal Website | Current Occupation</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After posting on TaskRabbit and getting no bites for an hour or so, I went to Exec instead. Within 10 minutes, I got a call from my new Exec and Sarah (name changed) got started.</p>
<p><span><strong>Correspondance with the Exec (edited for brevity)<br /></strong></span><span>30 minutes in</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah:&nbsp;</strong>Would you prefer not to post a 'conversation' between the user and other users who are commenting back to the main user?</p>
<p>Or shall I post some of those as well?</p>
<p><strong>Me:&nbsp;</strong><span style="">A link to the comment and a snippet of their comment (about a sentence) would be great! &nbsp;I'll follow the link if I'm looking for more context.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="">55 minutes in</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong><span style="">Excuse me, what does 'github' mean, please? Also may I add a column showing what they have posted...as in those links? &nbsp;I'm also having trouble getting their personal info from the first URL you gave me. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""><strong>Me:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="">- I'd take their username and google around to see if you can find them somewhere else online. &nbsp;No worries if you can't find contact info for all of them, but most should have a github/blog/etc which will have an email address. &nbsp;<br /></span><span style="">- Github is</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" style="">github.com</a><span style="">, a website that many engineers use to display code they have worked on. It's reasonable to expect most everybody who made a comment is going to have a github account as well, probably with the same username as the comment</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 hours in</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style=""><strong>Sarah: </strong></span><span style="">I have 8...still working...wanted to give you an update!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="">2:15 in</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah: &nbsp;</strong><span style="">OK...here it is...10 total now.</span></p>
<p><span style=""><strong>Me: &nbsp;</strong>Looks goo</span><span style="">d! &nbsp;[review briskly in the middle of other work]&nbsp;The one detail I'd love to have, that I wasn't clear about in retrospect, would be the name of their current employer (in position, rather than the title, I'm also interested in who they are working for).</span></p>
<div><span style=""><strong>Sarah:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of them don't say who they are working for, but I'll add that tab and go back and look at them again.,..if this goes longer than 3 hours. &nbsp;</span><span style="">is that OK with you? Or do you want me to stop at 3 hours? We are at 2hr.25 min right now.</span></div>
<p />
<div><span><strong>Me</strong>: Sure, stop at 3 hours.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><strong>Cost: $75 </strong>($25/hour)</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Aftermath</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Later that night, I pulled open the spreadsheet. &nbsp;The people Sarah had chosen were not necessarily the ones I felt had made particularly insightful comments. Sarah didn't have any domain expertise; as a result, I discarded a few of the 11 almost immediately and started to read through on the rest.</span></div>
<div><span>My workflow with the Spreadsheet was not optimal - I ended up bouncing back and forth between the links provided to figure out if this person was worth contacting. I was duplicating a lot of the work that I had hoped to have Exec handle for me, and am not sure how much time I saved (I ended up googling about half of their usernames anyway to find more things about them).</span></div>
<p />
<div>I did end up emailing a few people that were worthwhile, but I'm not convinced that between specifying the task, managing Sarah and then looking through the spreadsheet I saved myself all that much time. Sarah was very friendly and responsive, but ultimately I tried to outsource judgment that required domain expertise, and was only marginally successful.</div>
<img src="/images/exec1.jpg" alt="My first time with an Exec" /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Takeaways for next time:</strong></div>
<div><ol>
<li><strong>Do it yourself first. </strong>I saw the opportunity and got excited about using Exec. The right thing would have been to go through 2 or 3 people myself first, understand my workflow, verify whether it was outsourceable, and only then document it and pass it on. &nbsp;If I were doing this again, I would probably read the comments myself and only ask to get the executive summary of a commenter be done for me externally. &nbsp;This would have probably only taken about 1 hour of exec-time.</li>
<li><strong>Give feedback early. &nbsp;</strong>I should have asked Sarah to check in after she finished each of the first few people so that I could give feedback and refine the task. In a couple of the cases, she added information that wasn't useful that I could have blocked earlier on.</li>
<li><strong>The Exec is not your clone.</strong>&nbsp;I expected too much tech-related domain knowledge out of my Exec. My description was wishy-washy and hoped for the best. &nbsp;Part of this, I'm sure, will come with expertise, but from now on I will try to describe too much rather than too little if I'm working with somebody new.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>I'll be back on Exec, less naive and frivolous about asking for tasks before I understand what I really want. &nbsp;Here's <a href="https://iamexec.com/r/efb7478514db45c946c2aa7157f53e1f">$5 off</a>&nbsp;if you'd care to try it out.</p>

<p>Once a week is tough. My most interesting and well-read blog posts have typically consisted of <a href="http://alexeymk.com/dear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter">lengthy write-ups</a> or niche guides&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://alexeymk.com/hosting-hackathons-the-organizers-checklist">hackathon organizers</a> or <a href="http://alexeymk.com/an-interns-guide-to-a-summer-in-the-bay-area">Bay Area tech interns</a>. It's not really blogging, per se - the writing model I aspire to most is <a href="joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</a>, a sort of Joel without&nbsp;the wisdom, experience, or wit.</p>
<p>So this is very different, and I can't say I'm particularly comfortable with it. These coming posts won't all be what I consider ready-to-ship, or particularly well-researched or thorough. &nbsp;I don't expect them to be nearly as well-read.&nbsp;Hopefully, they'll force me into improving my writing.</p>
<p>It's that or $5 a week.</p>

          <p>"Well, I wasn't really going to intern at X (say, Zynga, or Morgan Stanley) but they offered more than anybody else."</p>
<p><strong>Don't do that.</strong></p>
<p>It's easy to focus on the financial aspect of an offer, especially if it's the first time you've had a chance to make anywhere near this much. It feels kind of surreal.</p>
<p>It's not that money isn't a valuable proxy for how valuable the company perceives you to be. If you get an offer of "housing + we give you options in the company," that's a good sign that you are talking to <a href="http://WhartoniteSeeksCodeMonkey.com">Whartonite Seeks Code Monkey</a>-esque enterpreneurs and if you have anything remotely more interesting available you should go do that instead.</p>
<p>But the point of an internship is not to maximize your profits - it's to <a href="http://alexeymk.com/a-brief-guide-to-tech-internships">learn what kind of work or industry you want to be in once you graduate</a>, to try things out and live in cool places, and (more immediately) learn about how real-world software engineering works.</p>
<p>When you go out into the real world with six figures of college loans, sure: try to negotiate up your offers, consider the difference between $80k and $100k a year. &nbsp;This will make a substantial difference in how soon you will be free from debt. &nbsp;But when you are deciding where to spend your summer, the difference of a few $k is a small price to pay for learning about a potential industry or position or company that you are interested in as a career.</p>
<p>PS. &nbsp;In case you're wondering, here's an approximate price that companies are paying these days for technical interns. I imagine this'll be out of date reasonably soon, but here it goes*:</p>
<ul>
<li>~$10k/month - crazy financial hedge-funds where they have you do algorithms trading or something along those lines. Expect +$2k/month for every greek letter in their name.</li>
<li>~$7.5k/month - Google. I think Google still makes a point of paying 10-20% more than anybody else, but I haven't checked recently. Edit: Palantir appears to be in this bracket as well.</li>
<li>~$6-7k/month - Facebook, Dropbox, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, etc - top-tier tech companies. &nbsp;</li>
<li>~$4-6k/month - Various smaller companies and legit startups. &nbsp;I think normal finance-tech jobs are in this range as well.</li>
<li>~$2-4k/month - Less prestigious (or non Bay-Area) start-ups or small tech firms.</li>
<li>~$0-2k/month - Summer of Code, non-profit work, non-funded or silly start-ups.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* Note: I'm including housing in all of these.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind that a number of these companies also adjust by year, more willing to pay a rising senior than a rising freshman. &nbsp;I've seen this be a factor of up to 50%.</p>
