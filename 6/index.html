          <p>My weekend hack is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov Chain</a> baby name generator.  <a href="http://twitter.com/markovbaby">@MarkovBaby</a> will come up with a new baby name once an hour and tweets it out.</p>

<p><strong>The result</strong>: <a href="http://twitter.com/markovbaby">Follow @markovbaby on Twitter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-markov-chain">What is a Markov Chain?</h2>
<p>Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">the wikipedia entry</a> for a more thorough introduction, but in our case, a Markov Chain is a simple random process to generate text that looks sort of like other text.</p>

<p>For example: as we’re generating baby names, say we start with the letter “C”.  What should be our next letter?  Well, what kind of letters usually come after a “C” in names?  Let’s look through our <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyMK/markov-baby-names/blob/master/boys.txt">list of existing names</a> and see what usually comes next.</p>

<p><img src="/images/letters_after_c.png" />&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<p>Great.  Let’s pick the next character at random from within this list, weighing each possibility by how often it appears.  If we get ‘end of word’, we’re done.</p>

<p>But let’s say we’ve picked ‘h’.  Great - so far the name starts with a ‘ch’ - let’s look for the next character: what tends to follow an ‘h’ in our existing names?  And so on.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The result are a rather eclectic set of names.  Some are silly and non-sensical (C, Ieahaholijayson), while others seem pretty reasonable (Marin, Gacon).  A lot of them sound like they belong in Middle Earth (Miaviria), to Weseteros (Josth, Mindron).  Occasionaly it’ll accidentally recreate a real name. Those are my favorite.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/markovbaby">@MarkovBaby</a> may be suitable for an expecting couple with just the appropriate amount of eccentricity and love of statistics.</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/AlexeyMK/markov-baby-names">Is available on my github</a>.  Hopefully nothing too complicated; random.choice and collections.defaultdict proved rather helpful. I hadn’t touched Markov Chains since proving things about them in Randomized Algorithms class, so it was good to know that with a bit of clever python you could write one in a few dozen lines.  For reference, mine was an ‘order-1’ (IE, only look at one previous character) chain.</p>

<h2 id="possible-extensions">Possible extensions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Favorite or RT your favorite baby names, and I’ll put up a leaderboard for favorite ones.</li>
  <li>Apply the same techniques (and same code) to startup names, using crunchbase: Markov 2.0.</li>

          <p>I worked on non-technical hiring over this past week.</p>

<h4>Some Lessons Learned</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>There are a lot of people on craigslist.</strong>  We got over 160 applicants for our post.</li>
  <li><strong>Some are pretty darn good</strong> 40 or so were potentially interesting, and I ended up with about 5 candidates I was very happy with at the end of the process.</li>
  <li><strong>Applications should be hard</strong> Our application form included several paragraph answers, forcing candidates to think and allowing me to evaluate their writing style.  This proved very helpful.</li>
  <li><strong>Templates are your friend</strong> That means 120 rejections.  For technical hires, I do my absolute best to give feedback, especially for younger candidates, on what to work on.  With this volume of candidates, include many just spray-and-praying their resume, I had to go with a template for most hires.</li>
  <li><strong>Duplicate test assignments</strong> for potentially worthwhile candidates, I came up with a realistic task that would take about an hour and asked them to send me their results before considering an interview.  I learned a ton from seeing more than 20 people complete the same assignment, including what I was looking for in an ideal candidate.  Things like how well they communicate with me, whether they ask questions (and whether these are the right questions or just things they could have googled), whether they are comfortable making assumptions and moving forward if I am unavailable, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Education is a far stronger signal for non-technical hires</strong> With technical resumes, I may glance over where they got their undergrad but focus much more on experience and publicly available code.  For non-technical hires, places they’ve worked/things they’ve done before aren’t nearly as indicative of quality (at least to me) as for technical roles.  The highest signals of quality (quality measured by ‘I am interested in hiring this candidate’) ended up being things like caliber of undergraduate education and the candidate’s ability to answer the initial questions well. Being used to the “it doesn’t matter where you went to school, what we care about is what you’ve done” school of thought for technical hiring, this surprised me.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Things I'd change next time around</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Send almost all of the candidates through the challenge first.  I met with a lot of candidates in person before sending them the challenge; in retrospect, in a buyer’s market, this should have been reversed.</li>
  <li>Filter for ‘having read the requirements’ by including a sentence like “Please ensure to include the capital of Denmark somewhere in your application.”  This would have filtered a ton of spray-and-prayers.</li>
</ul>

          <p>I may be a bit late to the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> party, but with Posterous being acquired by twitter a few months ago, I figured why not try it out. Two weekends later I’ve migrated enough that I’m comfortable shipping, though I imagine a bunch of silly bugs will remain. Please <a href="mailto:alexey-at-alexeymk.com">email me</a> with any issues you find, and I’ll get to them when I can.</p>

<p>In the meantime…</p>

<h4 id="moving-from-posterous-to-jekyll-what-you-need-to-know">Moving from Posterous to Jekyll: What you need to know.</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a></strong> is a static site generator created by GitHub for GitHub Pages.  It is rather extensible, so people have built things like <a href="http://str8.to/jekyll-boostrap">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://str8.to/jekyll-octopress">Octopress</a> on top of it.  I sort of half-used the former (adapted a theme) and didn’t know about the latter until it was too late.  Maybe/probably use Octopress if you go this route.</li>
  <li><strong>Migrating from Posterous</strong> kinda-sorta works.  The migrator that includes images/permalinks is <a href="https://github.com/pepijndevos/jekyll/blob/patch-1/lib/jekyll/migrators/posterous.rb">on github here</a>.  Some ruby required.  Here’s <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyMK/alexeymk.github.com/blob/master/posterous_import.rb">my hacky version</a>, with a couple of updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Comments</strong> I haven’t moved mine yet but a <a href="http://blog.jrmoran.com/blog/2012/01/31/importing-posterous-comments-into-disqus/">guide to move posterous comments to disqus</a> is available.  The decision to have comments (even moderated ones) is not one I’ve made yet. We’ll see.</li>
  <li><strong>RSS</strong> Here’s the <a href="http://recursive-design.com/blog/2010/09/14/integrating-jekyll-with-feedburner/">jekyll+feedburner guide</a></li>
  <li><strong>Developing Locally</strong> I used <a href="https://github.com/therabidbanana/guard-jekyll">guard to auto re-generate pages</a> as I was iterating on the CSS hackery.  Pretty useful, especially if you’re already reasonably comfortable with guard.</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting</strong> GitHub Pages will host for you at yourusername.github.com + let you host on your domain <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/blog/github-pages-email/">if you add a CNAME to your distribution</a>.  I’m about to try it.  Fingers crossed.  Also, I don’t know how much I trust GitHub to be so generous in the long run, but my next migration is going to be far less painful - “it’s just static content”.  <strong>Note</strong>: I was worried about where to stick draft posts, since the repo needs to be public, and my solution was to have both a public and a private repository, so releasing is “git commit -a &amp;&amp; git push public master.”</li>
  <li><strong>Markdown</strong> I admit I’m not too experienced with Markdown. Here’s <a href="http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet">my cheatsheet</a>.</li>

<p><strong>My description:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>I'm looking for contact info for a few (about 10-15) posters from a couple of blog posts (links below)</span></p>
<p><span>Result: I'd like an excel spreadsheet that looks like this, for every commenter that seems to be well-received. &nbsp;</span><span style="">You may need to start with the Username and google for all of their other info.</span></p>
<p><span>Spreadsheet format:</span><br /><span>Username | What They Said (+Link) | Contact Info (email?) | Github | Personal Website | Current Occupation</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After posting on TaskRabbit and getting no bites for an hour or so, I went to Exec instead. Within 10 minutes, I got a call from my new Exec and Sarah (name changed) got started.</p>
<p><span><strong>Correspondance with the Exec (edited for brevity)<br /></strong></span><span>30 minutes in</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah:&nbsp;</strong>Would you prefer not to post a 'conversation' between the user and other users who are commenting back to the main user?</p>
<p>Or shall I post some of those as well?</p>
<p><strong>Me:&nbsp;</strong><span style="">A link to the comment and a snippet of their comment (about a sentence) would be great! &nbsp;I'll follow the link if I'm looking for more context.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="">55 minutes in</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong><span style="">Excuse me, what does 'github' mean, please? Also may I add a column showing what they have posted...as in those links? &nbsp;I'm also having trouble getting their personal info from the first URL you gave me. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""><strong>Me:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="">- I'd take their username and google around to see if you can find them somewhere else online. &nbsp;No worries if you can't find contact info for all of them, but most should have a github/blog/etc which will have an email address. &nbsp;<br /></span><span style="">- Github is</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" style="">github.com</a><span style="">, a website that many engineers use to display code they have worked on. It's reasonable to expect most everybody who made a comment is going to have a github account as well, probably with the same username as the comment</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 hours in</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style=""><strong>Sarah: </strong></span><span style="">I have 8...still working...wanted to give you an update!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="">2:15 in</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah: &nbsp;</strong><span style="">OK...here it is...10 total now.</span></p>
<p><span style=""><strong>Me: &nbsp;</strong>Looks goo</span><span style="">d! &nbsp;[review briskly in the middle of other work]&nbsp;The one detail I'd love to have, that I wasn't clear about in retrospect, would be the name of their current employer (in position, rather than the title, I'm also interested in who they are working for).</span></p>
<div><span style=""><strong>Sarah:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of them don't say who they are working for, but I'll add that tab and go back and look at them again.,..if this goes longer than 3 hours. &nbsp;</span><span style="">is that OK with you? Or do you want me to stop at 3 hours? We are at 2hr.25 min right now.</span></div>
<p />
<div><span><strong>Me</strong>: Sure, stop at 3 hours.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><strong>Cost: $75 </strong>($25/hour)</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Aftermath</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Later that night, I pulled open the spreadsheet. &nbsp;The people Sarah had chosen were not necessarily the ones I felt had made particularly insightful comments. Sarah didn't have any domain expertise; as a result, I discarded a few of the 11 almost immediately and started to read through on the rest.</span></div>
<div><span>My workflow with the Spreadsheet was not optimal - I ended up bouncing back and forth between the links provided to figure out if this person was worth contacting. I was duplicating a lot of the work that I had hoped to have Exec handle for me, and am not sure how much time I saved (I ended up googling about half of their usernames anyway to find more things about them).</span></div>
<p />
<div>I did end up emailing a few people that were worthwhile, but I'm not convinced that between specifying the task, managing Sarah and then looking through the spreadsheet I saved myself all that much time. Sarah was very friendly and responsive, but ultimately I tried to outsource judgment that required domain expertise, and was only marginally successful.</div>
<img src="/images/exec1.jpg" alt="My first time with an Exec" /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Takeaways for next time:</strong></div>
<div><ol>
<li><strong>Do it yourself first. </strong>I saw the opportunity and got excited about using Exec. The right thing would have been to go through 2 or 3 people myself first, understand my workflow, verify whether it was outsourceable, and only then document it and pass it on. &nbsp;If I were doing this again, I would probably read the comments myself and only ask to get the executive summary of a commenter be done for me externally. &nbsp;This would have probably only taken about 1 hour of exec-time.</li>
<li><strong>Give feedback early. &nbsp;</strong>I should have asked Sarah to check in after she finished each of the first few people so that I could give feedback and refine the task. In a couple of the cases, she added information that wasn't useful that I could have blocked earlier on.</li>
<li><strong>The Exec is not your clone.</strong>&nbsp;I expected too much tech-related domain knowledge out of my Exec. My description was wishy-washy and hoped for the best. &nbsp;Part of this, I'm sure, will come with expertise, but from now on I will try to describe too much rather than too little if I'm working with somebody new.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>I'll be back on Exec, less naive and frivolous about asking for tasks before I understand what I really want. &nbsp;Here's <a href="https://iamexec.com/r/efb7478514db45c946c2aa7157f53e1f">$5 off</a>&nbsp;if you'd care to try it out.</p>

<p>Iron Blogger is simple. &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>Write a blog post once a week. &nbsp;If (and when) you don't: you owe $5. &nbsp;When there's enough money in the digital pot to afford a sufficient quantity of beer, a meetup is convened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once a week is tough. My most interesting and well-read blog posts have typically consisted of <a href="http://alexeymk.com/dear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter">lengthy write-ups</a> or niche guides&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://alexeymk.com/hosting-hackathons-the-organizers-checklist">hackathon organizers</a> or <a href="http://alexeymk.com/an-interns-guide-to-a-summer-in-the-bay-area">Bay Area tech interns</a>. It's not really blogging, per se - the writing model I aspire to most is <a href="joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</a>, a sort of Joel without&nbsp;the wisdom, experience, or wit.</p>
<p>So this is very different, and I can't say I'm particularly comfortable with it. These coming posts won't all be what I consider ready-to-ship, or particularly well-researched or thorough. &nbsp;I don't expect them to be nearly as well-read.&nbsp;Hopefully, they'll force me into improving my writing.</p>
<p>It's that or $5 a week.</p>
