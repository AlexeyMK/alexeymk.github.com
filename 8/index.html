<p><strong>Cheat Sheet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't spend your time looking for a technical co-founder, it's not an efficient use of your time. Instead, either: <ol>
<li>Learn to code     
<ul>
<li>Step needing to rely on others for execution</li>
<li>Meet technical people</li>
<li>Managing technical people becomes way easier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get an external team     
<ul>
<li>Don't offer equity</li>
<li>Agile:       
<ul>
<li>Weekly useful versions of the product</li>
<li>Pay weekly or hourly</li>
<li>A successful project doesn't 'end'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peanuts ==&gt; Monkeys</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid a 'tech play'     
<ul>
<li>Use white-labeled 'off the shelf' services where available</li>
<li>Fake your back-end: launch with only a pretty design, do hard work manually</li>
<li>License the tech from a company in a different vertical or geographic location</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Other takeaways:   
<ul>
<li>No NDAs</li>
<li>Get a technical advisor</li>
<li>Ask for advice, not employment</li>
<li>Co-founders are looking for competence and traction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Do you want to work on the CSS for the new page we&rsquo;re building?&rdquo;<br class="kix-line-break" /> </span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Will my code matter? <br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">One of the greatest joys of writing code is seeing your code ship and run in the wild; &nbsp;having users benefit from your design decisions feels great. If at all possible, make sure the code you will be writing does that. &nbsp;There are (at least) two reasons it may not: internal software or dead software:<p /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Internal: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Joel Spolsky described the </span><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">Five Worlds of Software Development</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"> almost a decade ago. &nbsp;Internal software doesn&rsquo;t have to be well written or engineered; it is typically written quickly and then left to (hopefully) still work. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a ton of &lsquo;internal&rsquo; or &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; software in academia and start-ups, and being able to be good at writing prototypes or good-enough software is a useful skill; just make sure that it&rsquo;s not all you ever do. &nbsp;At some point, make sure you get to work on code that needs to be great and not good enough; the amount you&rsquo;ll learn about software engineering and code readability is drastically different.<p /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Dead: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Most start-ups fail; your code may never see the light of day. &nbsp;Even at big companies, one of my friends from this summer had her project cancelled half way through her internship for unrelated reasons. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no clear way to keep your code from being part of vaporware; the best that I can recommend is to follow your gut: does the project you&rsquo;re considering joining seem like it&rsquo;s going to happen with or without you, or is everybody living on a prayer? &nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Who had my job before?<br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If your potential employer has had interns before, ask to talk to them about their experience for a reference check. &nbsp;If a potential employer is trying to dodge the question of past experience, that&rsquo;s a huge warning sign. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What are the expected outcomes of our work?<br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">You&rsquo;re looking for two types of outcomes: first, a particular set of skills through the job, and second, products that you can point to and say &ldquo;I built that,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I built this part of that.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><p />Skills: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What languages/frameworks/libraries are we going to be using? &nbsp;Do my mentor/boss/co-workers know these technologies well, or are we going to be picking a lot of them up as we go? There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with having to pick up something new, (in general, most every project you do will probably involve learning to use a new library of some sort) but having somebody on the team with domain-specific experience helps. &nbsp;Make sure you understand what technical skill-set in particular you are going to pick up, and then check that the technology you are learning is the kind being used at the places you want to work. &nbsp;As of the time of writing this, I&rsquo;d personally recommend picking up some of [Android/iOS development, Coffeescript, NodeJS Ruby, Ruby on Rails and/or Python]. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><p />Resume: </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">One of your tasks as a CS graduate is to build a reasonable one-page resume/portfolio/github account showing off your credibility to potential employers for the summer or full-time. &nbsp;Be careful not to spend a year working on a project you can&rsquo;t ever talk about. &nbsp;<p />Ask: is this work I will be able to point to online? &nbsp;Will I be able to show the source code to potential employers? &nbsp;Are there any parts of my work that I can open source and stick on my github profile? The answer will be &lsquo;yes&rsquo; more often than you expect.</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What is the format/schedule for this job?<br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">There are a couple possible schedules for part-time jobs, from the very rigid (coming into the office on specific days and working set hours) to the very flexible (&ldquo;can you get this done by next week?&rdquo;). &nbsp;Which works best for you depends entirely on your schedule.<p />For me, having set hours for working part-time (but not full-time) has been a huge help. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got enough things going on between classes, work and extracurriculars that if I don&rsquo;t pencil in X hours a week for a particular activity, it&rsquo;s unlikely to get done. &nbsp;Working in a specific location also helps place me focus and helps avoid everyday distractions. &nbsp;Plus, if you&rsquo;re working for a start-up, they probably have free snacks. &nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of days for part-time work, I&rsquo;d recommend either one or two weeknights or most of Friday.<p />That said, everybody is different. &nbsp;It may be that you&rsquo;re able to get your work done in part-time chunks throughout the week. &nbsp;Regardless, make sure to speak to your potential employer about their propsed work schedule and try to understand their motivations. &nbsp;An answer like &ldquo;oh, we&rsquo;ll figure it out&rdquo; is a useful warning sign that the potential employer hasn&rsquo;t taken the time to think through how exactly your position will work.</span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">How often will we have code reviews or pair programming?<br class="kix-line-break" /></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If all you do is write code until it works and then submit it, there&rsquo;s no real mentorship going on; you&rsquo;re just a part-time employee. &nbsp;Mentorship means that you are getting feedback on your code consistently, if not for 100% of your check-ins then at least for a considerable fraction. Not every start-up can afford to do 100% code reviews the way that Microsoft, Google and Facebook can, but skimping on code reviews entirely is not acceptable.<p />Alternately, pair programming with your mentor means that you get to ask questions during your collaboration and absorb the kinds of little tips and tricks that are mostly passed down through apprenticeship. &nbsp;Best practices for pair programming as mentorship is worthy of its own blog post, but the one tip I&rsquo;d have is make sure the mentee has the keyboard for the vast majority of the time. <p />Code reviews or pair programming; potentially both. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re getting neither, you&rsquo;re not learning any more than you would be if you were working alone.</span></li>

Rates vary: I&rsquo;ve seen lab work at as little as $8/hour, internships can go between $12-25/hour and your pay as a freelancer is bounded only by your imagination and what the market will bear. &nbsp;<p />That said, at this stage in your career I&rsquo;d prioritize learning over compensation. &nbsp;Even at a relatively high salary, the fraction of your college loans that the internship will ever pay off is likely to be negligible. &nbsp;If your financial situation allows for it, I&rsquo;d pick at least your first or second part-time job entirely based on how much better of a developer the job will make you, and worry about the money later. &nbsp;Even if your sole focus is financial gain, a solid but unpaid internship pushes your lifetime value forward far more than a well-paying dead-end part-time job.<p />The difference between a great and a mediocre job/internship is huge. &nbsp;I learned more in 3 months at Facebook than I did in 3 years as a software engineer in the Israeli Defense Forces.<p />On the flip side, the benefit of a paying job means that the company is invested in you.<p /></span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What if they offer equity?</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><br class="kix-line-break" />&ldquo;Whatever they offer you, equity or salary, ask for the other one&rdquo;<p />I can&rsquo;t find the source of this quote, but it reasonably sums up the best practice here. &nbsp;The start-up is making a choice about compensation: whatever thing (equity or cash) they don&rsquo;t give you is the thing they consider more valuable, and therefore the thing you should be more interested in obtaining. &nbsp;<p />I remember emailing a web-developer who was a mutual friend when I was starting out and offering to work together. &nbsp;All was well until I offered equity &lsquo;as compensation&rsquo;. &nbsp;I never heard back. Start-ups throwing around equity offers left and right in lieu of payment are a pretty good &lsquo;tell&rsquo; for amateurishness, especially given how favorable the current climate is to entrepreneurs wishing to raise early-stage capital.<p />In general, I think I agree with </span><a href="http://hackerengineer.net/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; vertical-align: baseline;">my boss from this summer</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">, who basically considers the equity component of his compensation to be the equivalent of a lottery ticket - nice to have, but not to be depended on.<p />There&rsquo;s no hard and fast rule for whether to accept equity as early-stage payment or not, but &lsquo;no&rsquo; is a pretty reasonable default. &ldquo;Either pay me for my work or show me how I&rsquo;m going to get mentorship from this position,&rdquo; is not an unreasonable answer at all; don&rsquo;t be afraid to use it. &nbsp;For the less confrontational, a simple &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to work with you, but I&rsquo;m on financial aid and need a steady income&rdquo; is a completely reasonable excuse.</span></li>

<div style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got. &nbsp;Am I missing anything? &nbsp;Let me know in the comments.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><br class="kix-line-break" /></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">PS.

<div style="background-color: transparent;"><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Maybe. &nbsp;&nbsp;Your goals for a part-time job should be to learn and to get paid, in that order. &nbsp;No technical people on staff means you&rsquo;re going to have to pick everything up yourself. &nbsp;None or barely any payment other than equity means that you are effectively doing the work pro-bono. &nbsp;The question then becomes: is this a better opportunity for me than </span></div>

</ul>
<br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The answer is a maybe. &nbsp;If you are particularly passionate about the idea, or like me have a hard time focusing on side-projects that don&rsquo;t have solid deadlines, and you can&rsquo;t find an alternate position that lets you learn the same technology but get paid/receive mentorship, go for it. &nbsp;</span><p /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">PPS.

          <p>I'm a <a href="http://thedp.com">DP</a> columnist this semester, writing once every two weeks for the school newspaper on technology and entrepeneurship. &nbsp;The below is a reasonably useful list of applications that students should be using, both for Penn students and college students overall.</p>

Fiesta.cc is the best of both worlds &mdash; just email your collaborators and CC <a href="mailto:mktg101@fiesta.cc">mktg101@fiesta.cc</a> (or whatever name you want), and it creates a listserv for your team automagically.</span><p /><a href="http://www.scheduleonce.com/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">ScheduleOnce</span></a><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Everybody is busy, and scheduling sucks. ScheduleOnce pulls in participants&rsquo; Google Calendars to avoid the chain of emails around &ldquo;Well, what about 3 p.m. on Thursday?&rdquo; as well as the burden of manually entering every damn time you&rsquo;re free next week on a Doodle.</span></div>

My friends and I use Venmo to split dinner, buy drinks and even pay utilities. Started by two 2005 Penn grads, Venmo has apps out for Android and iPhone, but text messages work as well. No commissions at any step of the process. It&rsquo;s like PayPal, if PayPal didn&rsquo;t suck.</span></div>

          <p>Dear Future Intern,</p>
<p>Welcome! You just got an internship at this amazing start-up, so you're starting to look for housing and are getting pumped for your summer. Rightfully so - <a href="http://alexeymk.com/the-bay-area-is-awesome">the Bay Area is awesome</a>! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent my last two summers out here as an intern, first at Facebook and (am currently at my last day) at <a href="http://www.2bkco.com">2bkco</a>, an early-stage, awesome start-up. &nbsp;It took me a while to figure out what <strong>the things to do</strong> were out here, especially as the only intern at a small company. &nbsp;Hopefully, the following will get you off to a running start:</p>
<p><em>[Note: What'd I miss/get way wrong? Let me know in the comments]</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Housing</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Where should I live?</strong></p>
<p>Live in San Francisco, Mountain View, or Palo Alto. &nbsp;As far as start-ups go, San Francisco is more artsy/hipster-ish/design-friendly, with a ton of startups mostly in the SOMA district and (from what I can tell) more reasonable working hours than down in MV/PA. &nbsp;If you want a well-rounded summer, San Francisco means that there is a ton to explore around the city without going to the same place twice, from dive bars to fantastic restaurants, to Golden Gate Park to Mission Burritos. &nbsp;San Francisco is fun. &nbsp;I lived in Mountain View during my summer at Facebook; some friends bashed MTV as being a dead town, but I don't necessarily agree - Castro Street is a reasonable downtown, and so long as you know other interns/people in tech, you're not going to be bored. Palo Alto is just north of MTV (45 minute bike ride), a bit more upscale/happening, but therefore more expensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary if you live anywhere else - from what I've heard, it's tough to get out to events and there just isn't the critical mass of other interns/people from tech. &nbsp;I have been especially advised not to live in north San Jose. &nbsp;There area also areas of SF you don't want to live in - the Tenderloin, most of the Mission, parts of SOMA. Check out <a href="http://hood.theory.org/map.html">this amazing map</a>&nbsp;that figures out neighborhoods in SF based on Craigslist postings. &nbsp;Also make sure to check out the <a href="http://www.walkscore.com">Walk Score</a>&nbsp;of a place before agreeing to live there and aim for 75 or above.</p>
<p><strong>How do I find housing/How much should I pay?</strong></p>
<p>Figure out who you are going to live (probably friends from college/general friends also out in the area) and start looking. Early. Looking for housing sucks and the market is pretty competitive, so just try to get it out of the way as early as you can.</p>
<p>Note: it is really hard to find a more than 4-or-so bedroom house in SF. We were looking to put together a huge hacker house and it completely fell through just because of the types of houses that were on the market.</p>
<p>Expect to pay about $1,000 per person per month - slightly less in Mountain View, perhaps. &nbsp;You can try to find something cheaper, but we were at the point where we were ready to pay up to $1,100 or $1,200 a person a month just to get something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of tools, <a href="http://www.padmapper.com">PadMapper</a>&nbsp;is a fantastic layer on top of Craigslist that helps you look for houses that fit your criteria, including subscribing to new listings via email. &nbsp;I'm still waiting for a somebody to solve Housing to Bay Area interns by owning mass inventory - I spent at least 15 hours over spring semester looking for housing.</p>
<p><strong>Weather: </strong>A quick aside: San Francisco is consistently at around 55F over the summer (light jacket and jeans) and Mountain View/Palo Alto are at around 75 (t-shirt and shorts or jeans). &nbsp;It rains in SF, but very rarely. &nbsp;FYI, so you know what to bring.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Transportation</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Public Transit</strong></p>
<p>If you are not in San Francisco, try to be somewhere reasonably near your Caltrain stop - you'll be going around the Bay Area reasonably often. &nbsp;I've had friends live 30 minutes away from a Caltrain stop and barely ever hang out with us as a result. &nbsp;FYI: It takes about an hour to get from Mountain View/Palo Alto to San Francisco on the Caltrain. Bikes are welcome.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, public transportation is surprisingly awesome. &nbsp;BART is the express let-us-get-you-to-popular-places line and MUNI is the normal, comprehensive transporation grid. I lived a 10-minute walk from a BART stop and was very happy with that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>From everything I've heard, the VTA (Mountain View to San Jose, as well as other routes) sucks. &nbsp;Don't depend on it as a primary mode of transportation.</p>
<p>Aim for a short (&lt;60minute, ideally &lt;30 minute) commute. If you're working for a big-enough company (Yahoo, Google, Facebook, etc), these will tend to have shuttles from various places in the Bay Area that drive you to work. Those are awesome. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bicycle</strong></p>
<p>I strongly recommend getting a bike, though. I had a 30-minute commute by bike both summers. &nbsp;It was the only exercise I got all summer, and it was great. &nbsp;Plus, bikes make it easier to get around Palo Alto and Mountain View, whose public transportation options are nothing to brag about. &nbsp;Same goes for San Francisco - I'm a 30-minute bike ride from anywhere, and I love the freedom of not having to wait for public transit. &nbsp;The Bay Area is incredibly bike-friendly: bike lanes everywhere, and awesome bike trails to hit if you're in the athletic mood some weekend. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To procure a bike, consider one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summer rental from Stanford's <a href="http://campusbikeshop.com/">Campus Bike Shop</a>. &nbsp;Rent an awesome bike for the whole summer for ~$300 and don't worry about maintenance/selling it at the end.</li>
<li>Buy a bike (either at a new bike store, for about $500+, or off of Craigslist, for ~$200) and either ship it back to your campus (~$120) or try to sell it at the end of the summer, again through Craigslist. &nbsp;I ended up buying a bicycle and selling it, just to avoid the effort of the Craigslist shopper's experience. &nbsp;All in all, I depreciated about $200 from my bike over the summer, marginally cheaper than having just rented it.</li>
<li>Ship one from your home/campus; again, expect to pay about $120 for shipping each way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rent-a-Car</strong></p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://www.zipcar.com">ZipCar</a>&nbsp;is apparently friendly to 18+ year-old drivers. I ended up renting a car the old-fashioned way over weekends for road trips, but ZipCar might be cheaper for evening trips. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Things to Do (tech)</strong></span></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intern-Specific</strong></p>
<p>The questions an intern (especially at a smaller company without a formal intern program) is going to face is, how do I meet other interns/hear about intern-specific events that I should be going to? &nbsp;I'm not sure which of the programs/list-servs below are going to persist next year, but here's what was up (that I know of) this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://startuproots.org">StartupRoots </a>is a non-profit that hosts speaker events once a week, specifically for start-up interns. I only went to one event, but the vibe that I got was that the speakers were interesting and the community of ~50 interns that showed up to most events was a solid one. &nbsp;The weekly program costs $150 or so (to cover food), and the idea (from what I understood) was that your start-up would pay for that as part of your internship. &nbsp;If not, pay yourself. It's well worth it. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Apparently, there was a <a href="https://wednesdays.com/g/bayareaintern ">Wednesdays.com Bay Area Intern</a> group this summer. Unfortunately, I only found out about it while doing research for this article.</li>
<li>Your school should have a Facebook Group or a list-serv for people in the Bay Area over the summer. If it doesn't, start one. Ours at Penn was pretty useful.</li>
<li>Figure out who backs your start-up; I know that at least YCombinator, True Ventures and Andreesen Horowitz had intern programs (or at least list-servs) for interns at their start-ups. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Any time I would hear of an event over the summer, it would be through one of these groups. It was pretty frustrating, actually, that there was not a single group somewhere for all of these intern/tech/Bay Area events. &nbsp;In an effort to solve this problem, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/237984646237494/ ">here's a group for next year</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Intern Events</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the summer, start-ups and larger companies consistently had fun events for general Bay Area interns. Throughout the summer, I either went or heard about events at Facebook, Stripe, Color, Yelp, Twitter, Bump, LikeALittle, LinkedIn, Mozilla, Twilio, Quora and Dropbox. &nbsp;Several companies (LinkedIn, Mozilla, Stripe, Quora) held intern hackathons that (from what I hear) were a bunch of fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do I hear about one of these? &nbsp;</strong>Keep your head up and follow the list-servs above. If there's a particular company that you are interested in, email the recruiter, introduce yourself as an intern at X this summer and mention that you'd love to check the company out/be notified of any such events. Assertiveness is impressive. From my experience, approaches like this tend to work.</p>
<p><strong>General Tech Events</strong></p>
<p>Intern events are fun, but it's also worth checking out what the full-time tech scene is up to. &nbsp;Some recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hackersandfounders.com">Hackers and Founders</a> and <a href="http://str8.to/106-miles-meetup">106 Miles</a> are two of the tech meet-ups that I've been to and can say were a worthwhile experience to have attended. You meet a lot of people starting their own companies or working at cool companies or just generally interested in talking to other people in the industry. &nbsp;Github also hosts a monthly drinkup (if you're over 21) which I have not been to but hear a lot of good things about.</li>
<li>Worthwhile mailing lists that I'm familiar with include <a href="http://wiki.hackerdojo.com/w/page/25443/Information%20Sources">Hacker Dojo</a>'s and <a href="http://str8.to/startup-digest">Startup Digest</a>.</li>
<li>If you're the kind of extrovert that is comfortable meeting random new people, try <a href="http://www.grubwithus.com">Grubwithus</a>, which organizes dinners for new/interesting people.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you're super extroverted and all networky and everything, check out my roommate <a href="http://pastebin.com/H8DL1bj8">Max Wendkos' post</a>&nbsp;on networking in Silicon Valley.</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons: </strong>There's a lot of them here. If you can't find a hackathon that's happening on any given weekend, you're not looking very hard. &nbsp;I got hackathoned out somewhere around the beginning of July, so I'd advise not doing more than one a month or so. &nbsp;Still, some cool hackathons that I attended that will probably be occuring next summer as well: <a href="http://www.hapihack.com">HapiHack</a>, <a href="bemyapp.com">BeMyApp</a>, Mozilla's <a href="http://str8.to/mozilla-wsoh">World Series of Hack</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://wipconnector.com/wipjam/entry/the_muther_of_all_hackathons">Muther of All Hackathons</a>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Some of my friends also attended <a href="http://www.defcon.org">Defcon</a> in Las Vegas; form what I hear, they learned a ton and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.</li>
<li><a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org">SuperHappyDevHouse</a>&nbsp;is a fantastic day-long hackathon/meet-up that is run by the folks at Hacker Dojo, once every six weeks or so. I met a ton of people and thoroughly enjoyed the lightning talks. You should go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tech Hangouts</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I'm not sure if I've got all of these, but here are some of the cool 'people with laptops hang out here and you can tell they are your kind of people' places in the area:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>San Francisco: </strong>Check out <a href="http://str8.to/epicenter-cafe-sf">Epicenter Cafe</a>&nbsp;in SOMA and <a href="http://www.thesummitsf.com">The Summit</a> on 19th and Valencia in the Mission. &nbsp;The Summit is also the I/O Ventures incubator space and has delicious drinks (Berry Bomb Cooler and Loose Leaf Tea FTW) and great food. &nbsp;Epicenter Cafe's cool too, but they charge for the Wifi.</li>
<li><strong>Palo Alto:</strong> Every time I go to <a href="http://str8.to/coupa-cafe-palo-alto">Coupa Cafe</a>, I end up meeting somebody I know from somewhere, or hear an entrepeneur pitch their start-up to a VC or Angel. Kind of fun. No wifi on weekends, sadly.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Mountain View: </strong><a href="http://str8.to/red-rock-mountain-view">Red Rock</a> is the Coupa Cafe of Mountain View. <a href="http://wiki.hackerdojo.com/w/page/25437/FrontPage">Hacker Dojo</a> is, from what I hear, a 24/7 version of Super Happy Dev House.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Things to Do (non-technical)</span></strong></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Start-ups are awesome and all, but make sure you actually check out the Bay Area - the weather is fantastic and there are some great things to see.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bike the Golden Gate Bridge in SF: </strong>Rent a bike if you don't have one near Fisherman's Wharf, and do the two-hour bike ride through the Golden Gate Bridge and to Sausalito, (and Tiburon, if you've got the energy for it) then take the Ferry back. &nbsp;Bring a group of friends. Sausalito is beautiful, the trip is well organized for tourists and a lot of fun. Don't miss this.</li>
<li><strong>Walk Around the Santa Cruz Boardwalk: </strong>Rent a car or find somebody with one and drive down to Santa Cruz. &nbsp;Check out the Coney Island-style outdated boardwalk/amusement park (I'm partial to the indoor minigolf course), hang out at the beach (take a Surf lesson if you've got the energy), maybe play some Volleyball. A quick not on Beaches in Northern California: They're pretty cold and windy, and something like two beaches have real sand. Santa Cruz is OK on a warm day. &nbsp;It's still worth going, but don't expect to swim too much.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Napa Valley </strong>if you're over 21 and don't mind spending $100 or so in a day, go on one of those fancy Napa Valley Wine Tasting tours (alternately, Bike and Wine tastings are fun too). &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Organize a weekend trip to LA or a nearby National Park: </strong>Rent a car and a cabin somewhere. Book a couple of weeks in advance. Don't expect to find a ton of space for 4th of July weekend. I never went, but a bunch of friends did and they thoroughly enjoyed the experience. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Computer History Museum: </strong>another "I never went, but this comes highly recommended" things to do in Mountain View. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it (so far). &nbsp;Let me know if I'm missing anything.</p>

          <p>So, you've handed over some hard-earned cash to sponsor a hackathon - awesome! On behalf of hackathon organizers everywhere, thank you.&nbsp; Let's make sure you maximize your return on investment. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Aside: why should I be sponsoring a hackathon, again</strong>? &nbsp;</span>I go into more detail <a href="http://alexeymk.com/hosting-hackathons">here</a>,&nbsp;but the TL;DR version is: meet and recruit top up-and-coming hackers, expose them to your company and build relationships for when they start or join companies.</em></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>(1) General Advice:</strong></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li><strong>Show up.&nbsp; </strong>Seriously.&nbsp; Figure out who your friendliest outreach person is and have them come to at least part of the event. I recommend sending an engineer or (if you have one) a developer evangelist - they know how to speak the language and represent your company well.&nbsp; You don't have to be there the whole time, but show up enough to meet the cool kids.&nbsp; If you're not sure who the cool kids are, ask the event organizer. We know, and are happy to make the introduction.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Teach.</strong>&nbsp; A lot of hackathons (at least on the college circuit) are preceded by a series of tech talks. Figure out what you are good at - is it Coffeescript? iOS development? mobile CSS?&nbsp; Talk to the organizers about hosting a tech talk. A big part of the motivation for hackathons is to learn a new technology. Seeing who shows up to the talk, learns quickly and asks the right questions is a great way to both introduce yourself and start building a relationship with the right hackers.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Be personable. </strong>Companies do a much better job when they stop trying to be impressive. Don't send hackathon participants to a generic 'apply' page - hand out your email address left and right and talk to people. In most cases, this will be their first impression of your company. Make it a friendly one.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Be a good judge. &nbsp;</strong>First, (and this deserves its own post) being a sponsor doesn't necessarily mean you should send a judge, nor is judging the most efficient use of your representative's time. &nbsp;That said, if you are one of the judges, make sure to (1) talk to the organizer about their criteria (at PennApps, for example, we don't care at all about whether the hack has a business model or not, which is clearly not the case for <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a>. &nbsp;Participants need a mix of encouragement and feedback; make sure your representative is comfortable addressing a reasonably-sized audience and generally upbeat in demeanor.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Swag away.</strong> At <a href="http://www.pennapps.com/2010">PennApps 2010</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> sent us 50 t-shirts with the iconic twitter bird logo.&nbsp;<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;I still see these proudly worn around the Engineering quad, often followed by "whoa, how'd you get that shirt?"</span>&nbsp;Corporate swag is the clearest win-win-win proposition I've seen - companies increase their brand exposure (to <em>exactly</em> the people they are trying to hire), hackathon organizers have goodies to hand out to participants and hackers get swag they can wear for +3 geek cred.&nbsp;<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">You don't need to have the brand recognition of Twitter, but you do need to give student's a reason to wear your branded shirt.&nbsp;I&nbsp;</span>recommend cartoons - engineers love cartoons.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/162778_143909752333333_103140939743548_262093_8157698_n.jpg" alt="Realizing Rewards from your Hackathon Sponsorship " /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Get creative. </strong>In September, the <a href="http://alexeymk.com/its-like-your-wallet-and-your-phone-had-a-bea">Venmo</a> guys decided (without any prior warning) to show up at 3AM with bags full of&nbsp;Geno's&nbsp;cheesesteaks.&nbsp; I cannot begin to describe the sheer amount of goodwill they generated through that. A lot of students have started using Venmo since; I can't help but think that this is at least in part due to the sheer magic of 3AM Geno's. Another example: in January&nbsp;<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Arkitech brought massage therapists to offer 15-minute massages, a service greatly appreciated by hackers who had spent the last 18 hours in $5 chairs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">We even got one of the therapists to lead everybody in a stretching exercise.</p>
<p><img src="/images/IMG_20100919_025938.jpg" alt="Realizing Rewards from your Hackathon Sponsorship " /></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>(2) Specific Advice</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong style="font-size: medium;">You're hiring</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span> </span>&bull;<span> </span>Ask for resumes. </strong>Not during the&nbsp;hackathon, though - that is neither the time nor the place. Instead, ask the organizers if they might be able to help with recruiting as part of the sponsorship package. For PennApps, we collect resumes from participants opting in, (usually about 50% of participants) organize them into a spreadsheet, group them by hack, and send them to sponsors.&nbsp; Even if your hackathon doesn't do this, take a look at what has been built (either by attending the demo session or looking through the demos online) and ask the organizer for introductions to your favorite several applications.&nbsp; Be careful to be specific about this: as an organizer, I'm much more likely to offer to help if you've shown interest in things people have built than if you just ask for introductions to the "winners".</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Connect and follow up.</strong>&nbsp; When you have somebody attending, make sure your representative writes down contact info/emails for anybody who they were particularly impressed by. Wait a couple of days (let people sleep the weekend off) and then reach out: "Hey, I was pretty impressed by X that you were working on over the weekend - I'd love to get a cup of coffee and hear what kind of cool stuff you've been working on."&nbsp; Even if they don't end up working for you, <strong>the good kids at a school will, by and large, know one another</strong> - leaving a positive impression on one will get them to introduce you to others in their circle.</li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Hang out and help. </strong><a href="http://hackny.org">HackNY</a> did this at their most recent hackathon - at the end of the API demos, Chris asked mentors in attendance who were solid at particular layers of the stack to stand up and introduce themselves, IE "Hey, I'm Alexey from AlexeyCo, and I'm pretty good at Python, Ruby and the Facebook API. I'll be around until pretty late tonight so come bother me if I can help!" If you're trying to hire Python developers, establishing yourself as the company that has solid Python coders makes you an attractive place to work for quality Pythonistas.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>You've got an API to evangelize</strong></span></p>
<p><img src="/images/stretching.jpg" alt="Realizing Rewards from your Hackathon Sponsorship " /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knock your demo out of the p</strong><strong>ark.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Demo quality makes or breaks whether hackers get excited about the possibility of using your API.&nbsp; John Britton, who represented <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a>, knocks these out of the park (<a href="http://www.johndbritton.com/post/2010/august/05/7_tips_demoing_new_york_tech_meetup">here's his advice</a>). You have a couple of minutes to get attention, and you're competing for mindshare right there and then.&nbsp; If you're just getting started, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IgzefQ6a2OTMUlNZnHInzj26ORapZ822xm6P3DKOw4M/edit?hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CKSNpBs">here's a sample demo format we used as a guide</a> last time around.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Make developers feel special.&nbsp; </strong>In January, John not only hung out with us throughout the hackathon answering questions, but also handed out $100's of dollars of Twilio credits to anybody that talked to him about using the API. As a developer, that's great - this company respects me enough to give me special treatment - now I definitely want to give them a try.</li>

<li><strong>Connect with future dropouts.&nbsp; </strong>Ask the organizers who they think is most likely to stop out of school.&nbsp; See what they're working on and give feedback.&nbsp; Especially in the current climate, building relationships early on helps make the difference when entrepreneurs seek investment.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/11/15/invest-in-lines-not-dots/">Seed funding is raised through lines, not dots</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Help your portfolio. "</strong>Oh, you're passionate about marketplaces and design?&nbsp; Let me connect you to the folks at Etsy - you might enjoy talking to them!" Figure out what skills and culture your portfolio companies need and keep them in mind as you meet participants.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
