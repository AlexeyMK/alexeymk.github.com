          <p><em>TL;DR: Friend everybody you can on LinkedIn, then write recommendations for people you actually feel you can endorse.</em></p>
<p>I've struggled to keep my LinkedIn connections<a href="http://alexeymk.com/loose-ties-link-ships-friending-norms-on-link"> limited to people who I would feel comfortable vouching for</a>, but all that led to was an inbox full of ignored invitations from people I met at tech meet-ups and fellow Penn CS students. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/images/Screen_shot_2011-07-15_at_1.08.31_AM.png" alt="Sure, let's be LinkedIn friends" />And now I look bad, both because I'm rejecting these perfectly reasonable people and because I don't have the status of '500+' connections on LinkedIn. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I give up. &nbsp;Here's my new LinkedIn friending policy:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p>If we've met in person or online, and you are not a jerk/crook/philanderer, I'll accept your LinkedIn request. &nbsp;Let's be contacts!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The down side</strong></p>
<p>As the number of connections on a social network goes up, the strength and value of the median connection will, as a rule, decline. &nbsp;For LinkedIn, it means that people looking for introductions are going to have a far lower success rate asking for referrals. Referrals are (as far as I can tell) one of the key value propositions that LinkedIn offers - a lower success rate means less value.</p>
<p><a name="policy"></a><strong>Increasing signal through recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>I'd still like a way to indicate that I am confident enough in somebody that I would be happy to make introductions or vouch for their work. So, for people I've worked with, I'm going to start using recommendations. My recommendations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>'invite-only'</strong> - you can't ask me for one directly, and I won't ask you for one either. A compliment paid begged for has far less value than a genuine endorsement. <em>&nbsp;I'll be linking to this article at the bottom of each recommendation to make the invite-only nature clear.</em></li>
<li><strong>personal</strong> - "Hard worker, good communication, smart" sound like platitudes and boilerplate. Recommendations deserve better.</li>
<li><strong>immune to 'grade inflation' </strong>- it's not enough for us to have worked together. I have to be thoroughly impressed by you, both professionally and on a personal level. &nbsp;The fact that endorsements take a while to write means that I'll be writing less of them.</li>
<li><strong>a sign of personal affinity</strong> - if I've recommended you, feel free to ask me for help however you may need it.&nbsp;I've got your back.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>I'll go first. </strong>Here are three people I've worked with that I endorse without hesitation:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mark-west/5/814/6a7">Mark West</a> - </strong><em>Manager, Moore Business Office, School of Engineering, University of Pennsylvania</em></p>
<p>When we were seeking funding for <a href="http://pennapps.com">PennApps</a>, we (the CS club) briefly considered starting a LLC to avoid the hassle of dealing with the University system for finances. Working with Mark convinced us single-handedly to stay. &nbsp;To our first email with Mark, asking about processing Credit Card payments for sponsors, he replied along the lines of "unfortunately, we can't do it that way. Here are some possible work-arounds... let's reach out to X, Y, Z and see what we can do."</p>
<p>Mark made a usually painful process of accounting human and entirely manageable. &nbsp;He has answered emails on weekends, reached out across the University on our behalf and taken time out to double and triple-check our records. &nbsp;I thoroughly endorse him.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ericlondaits">Eric Londaits</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong><em>Freelance Web Developer</em></p>
<p>Eric was one of the best developers we worked with at fbDevDir. &nbsp;Usually, the process that I would go through would be to assign a task, follow up a number of times to figure out deadlines, and then spend a large amount of time arguing about issues of polish and bugs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Eric is great. &nbsp;He work quickly and answers emails with considered responses. &nbsp;The thing that I loved most about working with him, however, is that I didn't feel like there was a need to manage him at all - Eric cares about the quality of his work and does fantastically well with loosely-defined specifications. He combines an understanding of design and user experience in addition to development which means that he can be a one-stop shop for building cool stuff.</p>
<p>Eric was, finally, the developer (and largely the designer) behind&nbsp;<a href="http://look.fo">look.fo</a>/<a href="http://str8.to">str8.to</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matt-amalfitano/22/278/a85">Amalfitano, Matt</a> - </strong><em>Former President, Undergraduate Asembly, University of Pennsylvania</em></p>
<p>Throughout his tenure as President, Matt was a leader and a driving force for change at Penn. I worked with Matt and his team closely during the creation of PennApps and <a href="http://pennapps.com/labs">PennApps Labs</a>, working to encourage the administration to support student innovation and open up data for developers to build on top of. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Matt is responsible for helping secure funding significant funding for PennApps Labs, both from the Student Government and the University. I am not the easiest guy to work with - throughout our experience, Matt has been patient, understanding and open-minded. Though the movement Matt has helped begin is only starting, it wouldn't have been possible without Matt's strong and unwavering support.</p>
<p>[Matt also helped with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8tHlWStgTk&amp;feature=player_embedded  ">disaster recovery</a>. Worth watching]</p>
<p><em>This goes without saying, but: if you're not in this list, it's because I haven't had the time to go through everybody yet.</em></p>
<p>I'd be curious to see how others deal with their LinkedIn overflow.</p>

          <p><em>This isn't quite polished enough to be a blog post, but I'm putting it up for now to make sure the idea is out there. Release early, release often, right?</em></p>
<p>Via a <a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/facebook-owning-single-signon.html  ">hacker news post</a> earlier today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The Internet is at a dangerous inflection point.&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/108/" style="text-decoration: none;">Facebook Connect</a>&nbsp;is quickly creating a monopoly on identity [...]&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">That's a huge risk to every other company on the Internet. [...]&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">There is a terrific technical alternative to Facebook Connect:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/openid-for-security.html" style="text-decoration: none;">OpenID</a>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[In case I'm misrepresenting the argument, make sure to <a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/facebook-owning-single-signon.html  ">check out the whole article</a>]</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2670067">comments</a>, I jotted down some thoughts on why Facebook is winning and how I think the monopoly is going to play out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #828282; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Facebook's monopoly has come because Facebook Connect is an all-round better product. Publishers get access to easy syndication ("oh, you just joined XYZ? Here are some badges; want to share them on Facebook and let your friends know about us?") as well as higher-quality users overall (Facebook accounts tend to be real). Users get a single login from a service they (mostly) trust and easy integration with their social network ("oh, John's using turntable.fm too? Sweet!").</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The brilliance of Facebook Connect is the tie-in of syndication with identity. Logging in with Facebook is a better experience than just registering, for all parties involved. This is why Facebook Connect works and why MSN Passport failed a decade ago.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The monopoly side of things is going to become a problem in the coming years; I for one expect federal intervention in the form of mandating a common federated social networking platform (a la, but not necessarily, via the protocols developed by diaspora). Federation and decentralization is what happened with phones and with email; if Facebook/social networking-style communication is the next generation, it seems like a reasonable next step.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Most users will never tell the difference, at first - Facebook will remain their default client both for login and for reading friends' profiles and news feed. With time, however, competitors will begin to emerge and offer alternate interfaces for either news feed filtration or for identity, opening up space for innovation in a place once dominated by one or more entrenched players (Firefox vs IE, Gmail vs Hotmail/Yahoo/AOL). Early adopters will be using social networking tools but will be able to seamlessly interoperate with people still on Facebook.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Perhaps I'm naively optimistic, but I'd be excited for a future like that. For now, though, I'll stick to Facebook Connect - the bigger it gets, the more likely regulation will occur.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0px;">I hope the argument doesn't read as anti-Facebook; quite the opposite - I'm a huge fan.</p>

          <p><em>This is a second in series of posts on how to host a student hackathon, based on my experience with PennApps, as well as from participating in HackNY and PhillyGameJam and the hackathons at Facebook last summer.  For other posts in the series, see <a href="/tag/hackathons">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/hackathon_checklist_photo.jpg" alt="Hosting Hackathons: The Organizer's Checklist" /></p>
<p>The first <a href="http://pennapps.com">PennApps</a> hackathon took place on September 2010, and was put together during the summer before, working nights and weekends. &nbsp;Below is a (non-exhaustive) checklist of what kind of things needed to get done in preparation to, during, and after the hackathon. &nbsp;A list like this would have been useful to me last year as a new hackathon organizer, so (hopefully) it'll be of use to you. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: You can put together a Hackathon in much less time than a Summer, so your mileage on the dates may vary. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: large;"><strong>3-4 Months Before</strong></span></p>
<div style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
<div>
<ul style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
<li><strong>Event Timing and Format: </strong>Figure out when you're going to have your hackathon and what the format is going to be like (12/24/48 hours, or some longer period like Columbia's <a href="http://adicu.com/devfest2011">DevFest</a>). &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Key Partners: </strong>Figure out what key groups from your university you're going to work with to get things done. We got a ton of support from the <a href="http://www.pennua.org">Student Government</a>, our <a href="http://www.tech-house.upenn.edu/">Innovation Center</a> and the <a href="http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/">Provost's Office</a>. You'll need these as proof of legitimacy for your website. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Funding Instrastructure: </strong>You also want to make sure you're all set up to take funding once it becomes available. We've found most companies are happy to either pay via Credit Cards or write us a check. &nbsp;Our organization (the <a href="http://dinphil.com">Dining Philosophers</a>, Penn's CS club) is University-affiliated, meaning all of our funding needed to be made out to the University. If this isn't the case for you, feel free to give something like <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">KickStarter</a> a try. &nbsp;Either way, reach out to your relevant University partners and make sure you've got a way to take money once it's available.</li>
<li><strong>Design Standards:&nbsp;</strong>You're going to make t-shirts and print posters. To keep a reasonably consistent design standard, see if you can get your designer friend to contribute a logo that will work across various background colors and ideally a color scheme. &nbsp;Good design is a solid way to show legitimacy when asking for funding</li>
<li><strong>Website: </strong>Put together a simple static website explaining what the hackathon is, who is organizing it, what you're hoping to do and what you need (hint:probably money). &nbsp;Your audience at this point are the sponsors - <a href="http://alexeymk.com/hosting-hackathons">when you email them asking for funding</a>. &nbsp;<p />For the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pennapps.com/2010">first PennApps</a>, we ended up writing a bunch of plain HTML and using the <a href="http://apidocs.posterous.com/">Posterous API</a>&nbsp;to pull in blog content to the main page. &nbsp;The <a href="http://pennapps.com">second time around</a>, we used <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> - this took away some of our design flexibility but made it far less painful to drop in new content. &nbsp;We're sticking with WordPress.</li>
<li><strong>Location </strong>(ideally)<strong>: </strong>if you're lucky, one of the Key Partners (above) will be able to help you find a location for the hackathon that works for you. More likely, you'll need to spend some amount of time reaching out to the University to try and see where you might be able to host the event. &nbsp;We wrote up a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_QVSFCIQzeHLFWss59nrehv9N3M-645rY5-NPz-NrA/edit?hl=en_US&amp;authkey=CJaVgeEM">Location Requirements</a> document to help streamline our conversations with the administration.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>2-3 Months Before</strong></span></p>
<ul style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
<li><strong>Key Sponsors: </strong>Once you have a basic website and an idea for the event you're going to have, you're able to start reaching out to sponsors to get funding for your event. We started with high-profile sponsors with whom we had established relationships first, largely through internships. &nbsp;We reached out to Microsoft, Google and Facebook first; getting confirmations from those sponsors and being able to put them on our website made the rest of the sponsors easier to convince.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Content: </strong>By no means is it necessary to have any blog content for your site, but I figured that between interviews with past participants and the rolling out of updates, a simple blog would be an easy way to make the site 'alive' and develop some early buzz amongst students.</li>
<li><strong>Location: </strong>Try to have&nbsp;your location down by this point.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>1-2 Months Before</strong></span></p>
<ul style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
<li><strong>Sponsors: </strong>The Key Sponsors are going to make your life easier in finding the rest of your funding. Make sure you've approached <a href="http://alexeymk.com/hosting-hackathons">the funding sources </a>suggested in an earlier post.</li>
<li><strong>Judges: </strong>If you want awesome, important people to come serve as Judges for the demo session, you're going to need to ask them reasonably far in advance (at least a month would be nice). &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Tech Talks: </strong>One of the fun things to do at Hackathons is try new APIs and frameworks. Start to figure out what companies or individuals in the area you want to reach out to to introduce the APIs before the hackathon. Developer Evangelists tend to be pretty high in demand (on the Android team in particular), so make sure to start this at least a month in advance and try to work out the talk schedule in a way that works for everybody. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Schedule: </strong>Start to put together a preliminary schedule for tech talks, the hacking itself, meals, and awards/prizes. This schedule will be bound to change, but having a first draft helps get judges/sponsors/tech-talkers give feedback and start to form their schedules around the event.</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Website: </strong>Start addings sections on the website for the sponsors, judges, talks and the planned schedule (basically, each of the points above). If you're going with a blog, keep posting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>3 Weeks Before</strong></span></p>
<ul style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>T-Shirt Design: </strong><a href="http://blog.adamnash.com/2010/11/29/why-t-shirts-matter/">T-shirts matter</a>. &nbsp;Come up with an awesome design and make sure to get yours made ahead of time, rather than rushed and therefore more expensive. Fewer colors is cheaper (add about $1/color/shirt). &nbsp;We used a local store but I've heard reasonable things about <a href="http://www.customink.com">customink</a>.</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Outreach: </strong>Figure out who your attendees are going to be and how to find them. &nbsp;For Penn, emailing the relevant CS department list-servs and clubs on campus got the job done. &nbsp;Externally, we reached out through friends to invite hackers at other schools. &nbsp;Get people to sign up and commit to coming. We used a <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=151187">Google Form</a> the first time around and <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com">EventBrite</a>&nbsp;in January.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither quite satisfied our needs (which is motivation for another post), but EventBrite isn't bad.</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Location: </strong>In case you don't, you should REALLY have your location figured out by now.</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Food: </strong>Compile a list of potential caterers for the event, doing your best to keep it varied, healthy, and cheap (we aimed at &lt;$5/person/meal and only doing Pizza once). &nbsp;Go down the line and start contacting caterers to see if any of them are interested in providing food for free or at a deep discount in exchange for a sponsorship/recognition/etc (hey, it can't hurt to ask). &nbsp;Get prices and lead times (IE, if 20 more people than expected show up, how much in advance do I need to tell you by) and start working on a short-list.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Tech Talks: </strong>At this point, most of your tech talks should be solidified.</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Local Sponsors: </strong>There's a <a href="http://alexeymk.com/hosting-hackathons#local_groups">category of local sponsors</a> that should be able to give you stuff (Red Bull, stickers, schwag) that are worth reaching out to, but can be dealt with on a shorter time schedule. Note: some barter sponsors from larger companies may need several weeks to get things things approved within their companies - make sure to reach out to them in advance.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><img src="/images/hackathon_checklist_2.jpg" alt="Hosting Hackathons: The Organizer's Checklist" /></strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>5 Days Before</strong></span></p>
<ul style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Tech Talks: </strong>should be completely booked and know exactly when they are going. The finalized tech talk schedule should be up online and emailed out to participants</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Participants Counts &amp; Finalizing Orders: </strong>At this point, you should know approximately how many people are going to make it (so you can order T-shirts and food appropriately). &nbsp;I was off by more than 50% both times I tried to estimate the participant count for PennApps. &nbsp;Here's what I recommend: email everybody that has signed up about 5 days in advance and ask them to respond with 24 hours to confirm attendance. &nbsp;The number of people who have responded are a reasonably solid guess (something like 10-20% of even those people will have something come up, but yet others will end up inviting their friends, or somebody will hear about the event, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">The Day Before/During</span></strong></p>
<ul style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Posters, Posters, Posters: </strong>Put signs everywhere. If you're within a couple of blocks of the event, you should be able to know how to get to it.</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Event Logistics:&nbsp;</strong>Make sure the website is ready for the event. &nbsp;Figure out what your channels of communication are going to be throughout (Twitter? IRC back-channel?) and have links on the site. Figure out who the contact people are going to be for the event and create a Google Voice number that forwards to all of them. &nbsp;Put the number on the website.</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Social Media: </strong>Somebody ought to be manning your Twitter account/taking photos and potentially video interviews throughout. Participants will have worked their ass off throughout the event and deserve to have evidence to show for it.</li>
<li style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"><strong>Back-up Plan: </strong>Things are going to go wrong day-of&nbsp;(out of power cords/need more food/X just broke)&nbsp;inevitably, spending money is going to be the fastest way to solve a lot of your problems. Make sure you know where that money is coming from and who is getting reimbursed for it, and how. Save receipts.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Post-Mortem</strong></span></p>
<ul style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;">
<li><strong>Demonstrate Results: </strong>Either host links to teams' work or (ideally) share the <a href="http://www.pennapps.com/teams">videos of their presentations</a>. &nbsp;Teams (and the hackathon itself) need to be able to point to tangible results.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Promises to Keep: </strong>Whatever value proposition you made to sponsors, make sure you've kept up your side of the bargain. We send out emails to participants after the fact thanking and listing sponsors as well as making it easy for sponsors to recruit from participants.</li>
<li><strong>Get Feedback and Iterate: </strong>Both from the sponsor, judge, and participant side of things, ask for feedback and take note of what kind of things can be different next time around.</li>
<li><strong>Mark your success: </strong>The Hackathon organizers probably haven't slept in a while. Now would be a good time to buy them a drink.</li>
</ul>

<p>"The future is here. It's just not very evenly distributed"</p>
<p>- <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/venmo_screenshot.png" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" /></p>
<p><a href="https://venmo.com/i/alexey.WzH.piw">Venmo</a>&nbsp;is something of a futurist's dream except that it just so happens to actually exist. Simply put, Venmo is your mobile wallet: either through an iPhone or Android app (or SMS), you send and receive money from your friends.  Venmo takes money in from your credit card and withdraws it out to your bank account whenever you'd like.  At no point does Venmo take a commission (<a href="#how">see below</a>) from you or any of your friends. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a heavy Venmo user and have been one since about October 2010. I've made more almost 200 payments with just under 50 different people (at least since they started providing stats in January) and have gotten a fair number of my roommates and friends to use it. The service improves my quality of life in &nbsp;a non-trivial way.</p>
<p><strong>How we use Venmo</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/venmo_payment_1.png" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" /></p>
<ul>
<li>I try <a href="http://www.case-mate.com/iPhone-4-Cases/Case-Mate-iPhone-4-ID-Credit-Card-Cases.asp">not to carry a wallet around</a>, which works except for when we go to food trucks. Usually, at least one of my friends will have cash, so I can Venmo them immediately to pay for my part. Gone are the days of trying to remember how much you owe somebody and whether you've paid them back yet - Venmo makes paying your friend back take less effort than writing the reminder to pay them back.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Whenever we go out for dinner, trying to pay with multiple credit cards becomes a hassle (even if the place accepts more than one or two). &nbsp;With Venmo, one of us will volunteer to put their card down and everybody else Venmoes them accordingly.</li>
<li>One extremely useful use case we've found has been the "I'm going to Wawa/Starbucks, do you want anything?" scenario. Whenever anybody goes for a coffee or snack run at our house, we ask them to bring things back via Venmo, by paying with a message like "$4.55 for Grande Cappucino with Caramel and Skim Milk." &nbsp;This way, the payment and the order are in the same place, so the volunteer does not need to write anything down or remember what to get - they just open Venmo at the register and order the relevant items.</li>
<li>
<p><img src="/images/venmo_payment_4.png" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" /><img src="/images/209366_882057397747_618833_43160611_3380328_o.jpg" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" />As you can tell, we've fun with the 'message' space in the payment, since the messages (though not the amounts) syndicate easily to Facebook or Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="/images/venmo_payment_2.png" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" /> </li>
<li>Venmo has also been tremendously useful for keeping track of utilities with roommates. We simply have a Dropbox folder with all of our bills; at the end of each month or billing period, the roommate in charge of that bill simply adds the bill to our Dropbox folder and then charges us (with a link to the statement in the account). &nbsp;As roommates, we've benefited tremendously from Venmo's <a href="https://help.venmo.com/customer/portal/articles/13711-how-and-why-to-use-trust-">trust</a> feature: if two people 'trust' one another on Venmo, charges they make from one another are automatically approved (though the sender has 24 hours to cancel the payment just in case). &nbsp;Trust reduces the friction of paying bills with roommates to opt-out, making it something I don't worry about anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="how">How can Venmo afford to not take a commission?&nbsp;</a></strong></p>
<p>The short answer is, VC funding means you're allowed to lose money for a while.</p>
<p>The longer answer is: mobile (social?) payments in the US are a land-grab right now, with competitors like <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a> trying to get into the space, Google buying start-ups that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/13/google-zetawire/">haven't launched yet</a> and phone carriers looking to be part of the solution as well.  Mobile wallets have the same (if not stronger) network effects than social networks - if the friends I go out with or the places I go accept the service, I'll use it. If they don't, Venmo is useless. During a land-grab, fees are an unnafordable friction.  By leaving its business model discovery to late on, Venmo makes it easy for me to have this conversation:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p><strong>Dude: </strong>I don't have cash on me right now, can I pay you back later?<br /><strong>Me</strong>: Sure, just Venmo me.<br /><strong>Dude</strong>: Nah, That's too complicated. I'll just give you cash when I have it.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Me</strong>: It's actually really simple: I'll charge you $10 now. Follow the link you'll get in your email, and pay once you've joined. Venmo doesn't take a cut or anything.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Dude</strong>: Cool! &nbsp;...wait, then how do they make money?&nbsp;<br /><strong>Me</strong>: <em>See above</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I like Venmo and I use it a lot. <a href="https://venmo.com/i/alexey.WzH.piw">You should too (follow this link for an invite)</a>. &nbsp;</p>
