<p>"The future is here. It's just not very evenly distributed"</p>
<p>- <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/venmo_screenshot.png" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" /></p>
<p><a href="https://venmo.com/i/alexey.WzH.piw">Venmo</a>&nbsp;is something of a futurist's dream except that it just so happens to actually exist. Simply put, Venmo is your mobile wallet: either through an iPhone or Android app (or SMS), you send and receive money from your friends.  Venmo takes money in from your credit card and withdraws it out to your bank account whenever you'd like.  At no point does Venmo take a commission (<a href="#how">see below</a>) from you or any of your friends. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a heavy Venmo user and have been one since about October 2010. I've made more almost 200 payments with just under 50 different people (at least since they started providing stats in January) and have gotten a fair number of my roommates and friends to use it. The service improves my quality of life in &nbsp;a non-trivial way.</p>
<p><strong>How we use Venmo</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/venmo_payment_1.png" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" /></p>
<ul>
<li>I try <a href="http://www.case-mate.com/iPhone-4-Cases/Case-Mate-iPhone-4-ID-Credit-Card-Cases.asp">not to carry a wallet around</a>, which works except for when we go to food trucks. Usually, at least one of my friends will have cash, so I can Venmo them immediately to pay for my part. Gone are the days of trying to remember how much you owe somebody and whether you've paid them back yet - Venmo makes paying your friend back take less effort than writing the reminder to pay them back.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Whenever we go out for dinner, trying to pay with multiple credit cards becomes a hassle (even if the place accepts more than one or two). &nbsp;With Venmo, one of us will volunteer to put their card down and everybody else Venmoes them accordingly.</li>
<li>One extremely useful use case we've found has been the "I'm going to Wawa/Starbucks, do you want anything?" scenario. Whenever anybody goes for a coffee or snack run at our house, we ask them to bring things back via Venmo, by paying with a message like "$4.55 for Grande Cappucino with Caramel and Skim Milk." &nbsp;This way, the payment and the order are in the same place, so the volunteer does not need to write anything down or remember what to get - they just open Venmo at the register and order the relevant items.</li>
<li>
<p><img src="/images/venmo_payment_4.png" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" /><img src="/images/209366_882057397747_618833_43160611_3380328_o.jpg" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" />As you can tell, we've fun with the 'message' space in the payment, since the messages (though not the amounts) syndicate easily to Facebook or Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="/images/venmo_payment_2.png" alt="Venmo Review: It's like your wallet and your phone had a beautiful baby" /> </li>
<li>Venmo has also been tremendously useful for keeping track of utilities with roommates. We simply have a Dropbox folder with all of our bills; at the end of each month or billing period, the roommate in charge of that bill simply adds the bill to our Dropbox folder and then charges us (with a link to the statement in the account). &nbsp;As roommates, we've benefited tremendously from Venmo's <a href="https://help.venmo.com/customer/portal/articles/13711-how-and-why-to-use-trust-">trust</a> feature: if two people 'trust' one another on Venmo, charges they make from one another are automatically approved (though the sender has 24 hours to cancel the payment just in case). &nbsp;Trust reduces the friction of paying bills with roommates to opt-out, making it something I don't worry about anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="how">How can Venmo afford to not take a commission?&nbsp;</a></strong></p>
<p>The short answer is, VC funding means you're allowed to lose money for a while.</p>
<p>The longer answer is: mobile (social?) payments in the US are a land-grab right now, with competitors like <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a> trying to get into the space, Google buying start-ups that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/13/google-zetawire/">haven't launched yet</a> and phone carriers looking to be part of the solution as well.  Mobile wallets have the same (if not stronger) network effects than social networks - if the friends I go out with or the places I go accept the service, I'll use it. If they don't, Venmo is useless. During a land-grab, fees are an unnafordable friction.  By leaving its business model discovery to late on, Venmo makes it easy for me to have this conversation:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p><strong>Dude: </strong>I don't have cash on me right now, can I pay you back later?<br /><strong>Me</strong>: Sure, just Venmo me.<br /><strong>Dude</strong>: Nah, That's too complicated. I'll just give you cash when I have it.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Me</strong>: It's actually really simple: I'll charge you $10 now. Follow the link you'll get in your email, and pay once you've joined. Venmo doesn't take a cut or anything.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Dude</strong>: Cool! &nbsp;...wait, then how do they make money?&nbsp;<br /><strong>Me</strong>: <em>See above</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I like Venmo and I use it a lot. <a href="https://venmo.com/i/alexey.WzH.piw">You should too (follow this link for an invite)</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>With finals over, <a href="http://dinphil.com">we</a>&nbsp;are starting to lay the groundwork for the next&nbsp;<a href="http://2011.pennapps.com">PennApps 2011</a> hackathon, scheduled from September 2011. As we go through the process, we're making sure to have an organizational structure that ensures that key tasks have owners who are ultimately responsible for getting things done.</p>
<p>It's (theoretically) possible to organize a hackathon by yourself, but the task is pretty large if done right. At least three distinct skill-sets end up being required:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical </strong>Your hackathon is going to need a website. &nbsp;Depending on the technology being used, you may want to provide simple hosting/accounts for participants or unlock a number of phones if you're offering loaner units. &nbsp;If you have any sort of popular voting or demos after the competition, that part probably needs to be built as well. <p />Somebody who understands and can (at least competently) put together a website and administer a Linux VPS somewhere is going to be helpful. We had several people work on the technical side for PennApps, but having a key person understand the entirety of the tech stack meant that there was a central go-to person who could troubleshoot and distribute work.<p /><em><a href="http://7cubedproject.com/">Gareth</a> adds:</em>&nbsp;<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">One thing we found in 7Cubed was that it was a huge headache if we used personal accounts for blogs/website registration/etc. This made it so only a single person could make changes to these resources, which caused a bunch of friction.&nbsp;<br /></span><br />The solution there (or at least one we've been using) is to create a <a href="mailto:your-hackathon@gmail.com">your-hackathon@gmail.com</a> (or, if you don't mind configuring <a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new">Google Apps</a>, <a href="mailto:hackathon@your-domain.com">hackathon@your-domain.com</a>) and share the password across the people that neeed to register/maintain everything. &nbsp;This is not a particularly high-security approach, but works splendidly for something limited like a hackathon.</li>
<li><strong>External&nbsp;</strong>Hackathons require a lot of conversations, from <a href="http://alexeymk.com/hosting-hackathons">sponsors</a>&nbsp;to judges to the University administration to the providers of the location to the students themselves. &nbsp;We also ended up working with the University's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tech-house.upenn.edu/">innovation hub</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://pennua.org">student government</a>&nbsp;as well.<p />Reaching out and keeping all of these stakeholders happy is a job all in itself, requiring a diplomatic approach and an enthusiasm for convincing people to help you. &nbsp;In practice, the external person tends to also make sense as a reasonable MC for the kick-off and the person who gets enough sleep during the hackathon itself to be coherent enough to run the demo session.<p /><em><a href="http://7cubedproject.com/">Gareth</a> adds: </em>T<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">here should be a single person operating external relations, or at least a single person assigned to manage each single external relationship. This prevents the "oh I thought you replied to that three days ago!" syndrome.</span></li>
<li><strong>Operational </strong>We've found that a hackathon demands a reasonable amount of 'running' during the event itself. From registering participants and making sure they have a place to work and sleep to ensuring timely food delivery to ensuring that judges and speakers are able to arrive on time to are well treated during the event, to running midnight raffles, we've found that having a dedicated "behind the scenes" role ends up being critical to a smoothly-running event.<p />Unlike the first two, the operational role doesn't require a substntial amount of work until a few days before and during the event. Bringing in somebody who hasn't spent the past several months sweating over the planning details helped us get a fresh perspective and not worry about the quality of day-of execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your organizational structure may have multiple people wearing multiple hats or certain roles split; regardless, make sure everybody on the organizing team (and probably amongst the participants as well) knows who the go-to people are when questions arise.</p>

          <p>[Edit - I consider this post to be pretty out of date (don't start with PHP anymore!) but have not yet updated it. &nbsp;The one-line answer today would be to use a minimalist Ruby or Python framework (Bottle.py or Sinatra) to get started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Say you know basic programming, probably through some Java or high school APs, but you've never written a line of PHP or had to deal with anything with Unix. Now you want to get into programming for the web. What should you read/do/etc? &nbsp;Provided is an early draft at a bare-minimum comprehensive guide.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. &nbsp;How the Web/Web Servers work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>simplified, high-level overview&nbsp;<a href="http://www.quackit.com/web_servers/tutorial/how_web_servers_work.cfm">http://www.quackit.com/web_servers/tutorial/how_web_servers_work.cfm</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. &nbsp;Front-end (HTML/CSS)</strong></p>
<p>Update: W3Schools is pretty <a href="http://www.w3fools.com">out of date</a>. Let's use the Google tutorials instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS/(+Javascript): tAdvice from Google Engineers: <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/submissions/html-css-javascript/">http://code.google.com/edu/submissions/html-css-javascript/</a></li>
<li>New Stuff: Dive into HTML5&nbsp;<a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/">http://diveintohtml5.org/</a>&nbsp;(just do the first couple of chapters, more if desired)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Back-end language</strong></p>
<p>If you're just getting started and don't have a particular reason not to, <strong>use PHP. &nbsp;</strong>I'm writing this for some work that's going to be done in Rails, but PHP is probably a simpler starting language. I'll include links for both:</p>
<p><strong>Ruby on Rails </strong>(Ruby is the Language, Rails is the Framework)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby:&nbsp;<a href="http://tryruby.org/">http://tryruby.org/</a>. Sprint through this. If you've worked with Python/Javascript/any other scripting language, you should be on top of this.</li>
<li>Rails intro. Rails&nbsp;for zombies&nbsp;<a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">http://railsforzombies.org/</a>&nbsp;is the crazy/fun one,&nbsp;<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a>&nbsp;is the official one. From what I saw with Rails for Zombies, it seems pretty fun.</li>
<li>Hosting: use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.heroku.com/">http://www.heroku.com/</a>&nbsp;to host whatever you'll be working on.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PHP: </strong>The official PHP tutorials aren't half-bad, but there's a ton of crappy, outdated PHP stuff out there. Googling 'how do I do X' in PHP will typically result in terrible advice; if the site looks out of date, it's suggesting that you do it wrong. Use these as a reasonable starting point if you go with PHP:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.firstpage.php ">http://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.firstpage.php</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.forms.php ">http://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.forms.php</a></li>

<p>You might not need to touch that much Linux (GNU/Linux, if you'd like) to get something done, but just in case, here are the bare essentials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Penn CS' unix tutorial:&nbsp;<a style="color: #0000ee;">https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1xx/Learn/Unix/Resources/UnixTutorial/</a></li>
<li>Version Control - kind of a good idea. Use git:&nbsp;<a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/a-gentle-introduction-to-version-control/23064">http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/a-gentle-introduction-to-version-control/23064</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also get an account on Github.</li>
<li>Editors: you'll want to learn emacs or vim. I'm familiar with vim - choose that one (arbitrarily). Use vimtutor to learn vim&nbsp;<a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html">http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html</a>&nbsp;or just type in 'vimtutor'.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What am I missing? Are there better guides suitable for beginners that I haven't found?</em></p>

          <p>Whoa. &nbsp;Thanks for all the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2477586">attention </a>and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/gw0y3/dear_dr_stallman_an_open_letter/">feedback</a>, <a href="http://backtweets.com/search?q=alexeymk.com%2Fdear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter&amp;ref=p1">everybody</a>! In case you're curious: I ended up emailing the letter to RMS and got a reply earlier today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I am skeptical of advice from people who disagree with what I stand for.</span></p>
<p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><span style="color: #888888;">--<br />Dr Richard Stallman</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, commenters seem to have had <a href="http://socialmention.com/search?q=alexeymk&amp;t=all&amp;btnG=Search">fairly positive</a>&nbsp;things to say, but a number ended up arguing against points I wasn't making. &nbsp;To be clear: I don't think RMS is wrong to argue for Free Software, or that he should somehow moderate his position; I just don't think mentioning 9/11 or the Swindle is particularly helpful to the FSF cause. &nbsp;If you haven't yet, check out the <a href="http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~pengp/Files/Stallman/">recording</a>&nbsp;of his talk and judge for yourself.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm incredibly grateful for all of the contributions RMS has and continues to make, but I don't think RMS (or anybody) is beyond criticism.&nbsp;To equate criticism of a tactic with criticism of an ultimate goal does not seem to be an effective way to encourage feedback or open discussion. &nbsp;I'd love to see an FSF which takes itself seriously through its spokespeople and campaigns, because I think a cohesive and credible argument from the FSF is an important part of the discussion about the future of technology's role in society.</p>
<p>Alright, that's enough buzzwords for one paragraph. Thanks for taking the time to discuss, everybody.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
          <p>Dear Dr. Stallman,</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to Penn and giving a talk on <a href="http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~pengp/Files/Stallman/">A Free Digital Society</a>;&nbsp;it was an honor meeting you. You mentioned that what you expected of us was to help the Free Software Foundation however we could; I'd like to take you up on that and offer both yourself and the FSF the following advice:</p>
<p><strong>Stop marginalizing yourself</strong></p>
<p>You make a number of very valid points. When a program is distributed without its source code, users don't have as much control as they would otherwise. Internet censorship is on the rise and presents a serious and credible threat to society. DRM is an example of false scarcity and doesn't make sense in the long run. &nbsp;But every time you use the word Big Brother or call the Kindle "Swindle," or make an aside like "even if you believe that the government had nothing to do with the attacks of September 2001," you go from making an interesting argument about freedom to being the crazy guy shouting at cars on the side of the road.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/images/impeach_vs_swindle.jpg" alt="Dear Dr. Stallman: An Open Letter" /></p>
<p>Most FSF marketing materials follow this "you're not listening to us, so we're going to make increasingly outlandish claims" approach.&nbsp;The closest comparison that I can make between the FSF would have to be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a> movement.</p>
<p><img src="/images/global_warming_vs_ms7sins.jpg" alt="Dear Dr. Stallman: An Open Letter" /></p>
<p>There are numerous arguments in support of Free Software that I can think of that do not have to involve a conspiratorialist tirade. When you talk about the risk of software as a service, you can mention that the US gov't is <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/03/amicus-wikileaks-twitter-case/">attempting to collect identifying user data</a> from the Wikileaks Twitter account, or the recent <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2011/0416/Crackdown-on-Full-Tilt-Poker-clouds-future-of-online-gambling">domain name seizures of PokerStars</a> and other online gambling websites. These are practical consequences of a lack of Free Software and, arguably, places where the government has been overstepping its bounds. &nbsp;These are the arguments I would have loved to hear from you, presented in an even tone and without the usual snark.</p>
<p><strong>Baby steps</strong></p>
<p>In today's world, it's not realistic to ask most users to completely abandon all proprietary software immedialy. Proprietary software is usually better, especially when it comes to UI Design and User Experience. When a student confronted you with this, you responded that if we truly valued freedom we would not mind the inconvenience of (for example) emailing copies of documents around instead of collaborating via Google Docs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Stallman, Google Docs is&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;useful. I imagine you're unlikely to have tried the service yourself, abstaining as you have from proprietary software for the past several decades. &nbsp;It may be worth trying the service out, if only to better relate to your target audience.</p>
<p>Dr. Stallman, you like to use the argument that proprietary software is like a drug, so let me extend that analogy: today's proprietary stuff isn't marijuana; it's heroin, and it's really, really good. You don't get somebody off heroin by lecturing them about how they should value their freedom; you switch them over to methadone for a while and let them slowly detox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To that end, please stop accusing users unwilling to shift to inferior software as haters of freedom; all you are doing is insulting us and inviting us to ignore you. Instead, consider offering practical alternatives and first steps for products that you would recommend. &nbsp;We live in a world where having the technological edge makes the difference between success and failure; asking us to just give up that edge for a theoretical idea of freedom is not going to work.</p>
<p><strong>Do what you do best</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Stallman, I have a tremendous amount of respect for your contributions to GNU, emacs and gdb amongst others. You are a man of considerable intellect and programming ability. That said, I nor the people that I spoke with about your talk found you to be a particularly charismatic or persuasive speaker. The only people that seemed convinced by your speech were the ones who had already been leaning towards your point of view to start with. Several friends of mine who had not heard of the FSF before left half way through because they were so put off by some of conspiratorial rhetoric above.</p>
<p>I wonder whether the Free Software movement might be better served if you spent more of your time mentoring up-and-coming hackers and writing free software that matches in elegance and quality some of the software that you have written in the past. When we asked, you mentioned that you do not write much code anymore. That's a shame.</p>
