          <p>I tried <a href="http://iamexec.com">Exec</a>&nbsp;for the first time today. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://iamexec.com/r/efb7478514db45c946c2aa7157f53e1f"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1lP6J.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR - don't half-ass the task description/understanding what you actually need.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motivation:<br /></strong>I had found a blog post with a ton of discussion online that had some great comments showing a deep understanding of the material. &nbsp;"These people are awesome," I thought. "Let's see who among them we could hire!".</p>
<p>Huzzah, finally a chance to try TaskRabbit andExec.</p>
<p><strong>My description:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>I'm looking for contact info for a few (about 10-15) posters from a couple of blog posts (links below)</span></p>
<p><span>Result: I'd like an excel spreadsheet that looks like this, for every commenter that seems to be well-received. &nbsp;</span><span style="">You may need to start with the Username and google for all of their other info.</span></p>
<p><span>Spreadsheet format:</span><br /><span>Username | What They Said (+Link) | Contact Info (email?) | Github | Personal Website | Current Occupation</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After posting on TaskRabbit and getting no bites for an hour or so, I went to Exec instead. Within 10 minutes, I got a call from my new Exec and Sarah (name changed) got started.</p>
<p><span><strong>Correspondance with the Exec (edited for brevity)<br /></strong></span><span>30 minutes in</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah:&nbsp;</strong>Would you prefer not to post a 'conversation' between the user and other users who are commenting back to the main user?</p>
<p>Or shall I post some of those as well?</p>
<p><strong>Me:&nbsp;</strong><span style="">A link to the comment and a snippet of their comment (about a sentence) would be great! &nbsp;I'll follow the link if I'm looking for more context.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="">55 minutes in</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong><span style="">Excuse me, what does 'github' mean, please? Also may I add a column showing what they have posted...as in those links? &nbsp;I'm also having trouble getting their personal info from the first URL you gave me. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""><strong>Me:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="">- I'd take their username and google around to see if you can find them somewhere else online. &nbsp;No worries if you can't find contact info for all of them, but most should have a github/blog/etc which will have an email address. &nbsp;<br /></span><span style="">- Github is</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" style="">github.com</a><span style="">, a website that many engineers use to display code they have worked on. It's reasonable to expect most everybody who made a comment is going to have a github account as well, probably with the same username as the comment</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 hours in</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style=""><strong>Sarah: </strong></span><span style="">I have 8...still working...wanted to give you an update!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="">2:15 in</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah: &nbsp;</strong><span style="">OK...here it is...10 total now.</span></p>
<p><span style=""><strong>Me: &nbsp;</strong>Looks goo</span><span style="">d! &nbsp;[review briskly in the middle of other work]&nbsp;The one detail I'd love to have, that I wasn't clear about in retrospect, would be the name of their current employer (in position, rather than the title, I'm also interested in who they are working for).</span></p>
<div><span style=""><strong>Sarah:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">Most of them don't say who they are working for, but I'll add that tab and go back and look at them again.,..if this goes longer than 3 hours. &nbsp;</span><span style="">is that OK with you? Or do you want me to stop at 3 hours? We are at 2hr.25 min right now.</span></div>
<p />
<div><span><strong>Me</strong>: Sure, stop at 3 hours.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><strong>Cost: $75 </strong>($25/hour)</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Aftermath</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Later that night, I pulled open the spreadsheet. &nbsp;The people Sarah had chosen were not necessarily the ones I felt had made particularly insightful comments. Sarah didn't have any domain expertise; as a result, I discarded a few of the 11 almost immediately and started to read through on the rest.</span></div>
<div><span>My workflow with the Spreadsheet was not optimal - I ended up bouncing back and forth between the links provided to figure out if this person was worth contacting. I was duplicating a lot of the work that I had hoped to have Exec handle for me, and am not sure how much time I saved (I ended up googling about half of their usernames anyway to find more things about them).</span></div>
<p />
<div>I did end up emailing a few people that were worthwhile, but I'm not convinced that between specifying the task, managing Sarah and then looking through the spreadsheet I saved myself all that much time. Sarah was very friendly and responsive, but ultimately I tried to outsource judgment that required domain expertise, and was only marginally successful.</div>
<img src="/images/exec1.jpg" alt="My first time with an Exec" /></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Takeaways for next time:</strong></div>
<div><ol>
<li><strong>Do it yourself first. </strong>I saw the opportunity and got excited about using Exec. The right thing would have been to go through 2 or 3 people myself first, understand my workflow, verify whether it was outsourceable, and only then document it and pass it on. &nbsp;If I were doing this again, I would probably read the comments myself and only ask to get the executive summary of a commenter be done for me externally. &nbsp;This would have probably only taken about 1 hour of exec-time.</li>
<li><strong>Give feedback early. &nbsp;</strong>I should have asked Sarah to check in after she finished each of the first few people so that I could give feedback and refine the task. In a couple of the cases, she added information that wasn't useful that I could have blocked earlier on.</li>
<li><strong>The Exec is not your clone.</strong>&nbsp;I expected too much tech-related domain knowledge out of my Exec. My description was wishy-washy and hoped for the best. &nbsp;Part of this, I'm sure, will come with expertise, but from now on I will try to describe too much rather than too little if I'm working with somebody new.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>I'll be back on Exec, less naive and frivolous about asking for tasks before I understand what I really want. &nbsp;Here's <a href="https://iamexec.com/r/efb7478514db45c946c2aa7157f53e1f">$5 off</a>&nbsp;if you'd care to try it out.</p>

<p>Once a week is tough. My most interesting and well-read blog posts have typically consisted of <a href="http://alexeymk.com/dear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter">lengthy write-ups</a> or niche guides&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://alexeymk.com/hosting-hackathons-the-organizers-checklist">hackathon organizers</a> or <a href="http://alexeymk.com/an-interns-guide-to-a-summer-in-the-bay-area">Bay Area tech interns</a>. It's not really blogging, per se - the writing model I aspire to most is <a href="joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</a>, a sort of Joel without&nbsp;the wisdom, experience, or wit.</p>
<p>So this is very different, and I can't say I'm particularly comfortable with it. These coming posts won't all be what I consider ready-to-ship, or particularly well-researched or thorough. &nbsp;I don't expect them to be nearly as well-read.&nbsp;Hopefully, they'll force me into improving my writing.</p>
<p>It's that or $5 a week.</p>

          <p>"Well, I wasn't really going to intern at X (say, Zynga, or Morgan Stanley) but they offered more than anybody else."</p>
<p><strong>Don't do that.</strong></p>
<p>It's easy to focus on the financial aspect of an offer, especially if it's the first time you've had a chance to make anywhere near this much. It feels kind of surreal.</p>
<p>It's not that money isn't a valuable proxy for how valuable the company perceives you to be. If you get an offer of "housing + we give you options in the company," that's a good sign that you are talking to <a href="http://WhartoniteSeeksCodeMonkey.com">Whartonite Seeks Code Monkey</a>-esque enterpreneurs and if you have anything remotely more interesting available you should go do that instead.</p>
<p>But the point of an internship is not to maximize your profits - it's to <a href="http://alexeymk.com/a-brief-guide-to-tech-internships">learn what kind of work or industry you want to be in once you graduate</a>, to try things out and live in cool places, and (more immediately) learn about how real-world software engineering works.</p>
<p>When you go out into the real world with six figures of college loans, sure: try to negotiate up your offers, consider the difference between $80k and $100k a year. &nbsp;This will make a substantial difference in how soon you will be free from debt. &nbsp;But when you are deciding where to spend your summer, the difference of a few $k is a small price to pay for learning about a potential industry or position or company that you are interested in as a career.</p>
<p>PS. &nbsp;In case you're wondering, here's an approximate price that companies are paying these days for technical interns. I imagine this'll be out of date reasonably soon, but here it goes*:</p>
<ul>
<li>~$10k/month - crazy financial hedge-funds where they have you do algorithms trading or something along those lines. Expect +$2k/month for every greek letter in their name.</li>
<li>~$7.5k/month - Google. I think Google still makes a point of paying 10-20% more than anybody else, but I haven't checked recently. Edit: Palantir appears to be in this bracket as well.</li>
<li>~$6-7k/month - Facebook, Dropbox, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, etc - top-tier tech companies. &nbsp;</li>
<li>~$4-6k/month - Various smaller companies and legit startups. &nbsp;I think normal finance-tech jobs are in this range as well.</li>
<li>~$2-4k/month - Less prestigious (or non Bay-Area) start-ups or small tech firms.</li>
<li>~$0-2k/month - Summer of Code, non-profit work, non-funded or silly start-ups.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* Note: I'm including housing in all of these.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind that a number of these companies also adjust by year, more willing to pay a rising senior than a rising freshman. &nbsp;I've seen this be a factor of up to 50%.</p>

<p><em>&nbsp;</em><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zmhnE.png" alt="" style="border-color: initial;" /><em>(via&nbsp;<a href="http://truths-secrets.blogspot.com/2011/11/next-step-in-my-life.html">this guy</a>, via&nbsp;<a href="http://flavors.me/stussified">this guy</a>)</em><p />Joel Spolsky, from the <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com">Joel On Software blog</a> and StackOverflow, wrote an article with <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html">Advice for Computer Science College Students</a> back in '05. According to Joel,&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter what you do, get a good summer internship.</span></blockquote>
<p>As such: here&rsquo;s everything you ever wanted to know about tech internships, plus some bloviating about my experience. The <strong>TL;DR is, </strong><strong>try to have at least two internships: one at a small start-up and one at a tech company.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Wait, who are you?</span></strong></p>
<p>I'm a CS senior at the University of Pennsylvania. I have interned at Facebook (Summer 2010), where I worked on application privacy, and as a generalist at <a href="http://2bkco.com">2bkco</a> (Summer 2011), a new startup from serial enterpreneur <a href="http://www.caterina.net">Caterina Fake</a> (Flickr, Hunch). &nbsp;Both internships were great and invaluable. They were also very, very different, in terms of both the type of work I had to do and what I gained from the experience.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: large;">1) How do I get a good internship?</strong></p>
<p>Luckily, a number of great posts have been written about this subject already.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.andrewmunn.com">Andrew Munn</a> has a great piece on<a href="http://www.andrewmunn.com/2011/01/how-to-land-an-internship-at-a-top-tier-software-company/"> interviewing and applying for tech internships</a>, focusing primarily on what larger companies are looking for.</li>
<li><a href="http://technologywoman.com">Gayle Laakmann</a>, author of <a href="http://str8.to/cracking-the-coding-interview">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>, has a <a href="http://2011f.pennapps.com/blog/2011/9/15/size-matters-how-coding-resumes-differ-between-big-companies.html">post on the difference between what startups and tech companies</a> are looking for.</li>
</ul>
<p>To which I add <strong>my two cents</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start thinking about summer internships around Winter Break</strong>. Make a list of potential companies and start applying. &nbsp;Don't be worried if the entire process takes until April or so, though.</li>
<li><strong>Get a referral</strong> rather than applying directly whenever possible. &nbsp; Ask upperclassmen you know (think: TAs that like you) who could make a referral. &nbsp;For earlier-stage companies, if they don't have an explicitly-listed referral program, don't worry about it: email the CEO. <em>Hint</em>: they are probably at <a href="mailto:firstname@startup.com">firstname@startup.com</a>. <img src="http://i.imgur.com/CAA1j.jpg" alt="" />
<div><em>(via&nbsp;<a href="http://gapingvoid.com">Hugh MacLeod</a>)</em>&nbsp;</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Practice technical interviews.</strong>&nbsp;If you're nervous about writing code on the whiteboard, try some combination of being drilled by upperclassmen, buying (and practicing going through) Gayle's <a href="http://str8.to/cracking-the-coding-interview">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>. Others also recommend interviewing with the companies you aren't as interested in first, using them to train.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize for what you can get. </strong>Bigger companies are going to (generally) look for a high GPA and good performance on brain teasers. &nbsp;Smaller companies are going to prioritize a history of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/05.html">initiative and automony</a>, as shown by cool projects on your resume. &nbsp;If you've got a high GPA (at least 3.7 at Penn, say) and are good at brain teasers, you should be OK with larger companies; if not, start with a start-up.</li>
<li><strong>Your timing is great! </strong>Literally everybody is looking for software engineers right now, and internships are one of the key ways to recruit for companies. The market could not be any better for us. If you feel like you're not getting anywhere, make sure to apply beyond whatever is immediately available on campus. Competing with the general populace may be easier than competing with others at your university.</li>
<li><strong>Consider a mass-application or 'summer program', </strong>which are often offered by venture capital firms and have&nbsp;gained popularity in recent years. &nbsp;Make sure to check out (and potentially apply via):&nbsp;<a href="http://hackny.org/a/students/">hackNY fellows</a>, <a href="http://a16z.com/talent-services/">Andreesen Horowitz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.firstround.com/university">First Round Capital</a>, <a href="http://www.trueventures.com/tec/">True Ventures</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://kpcbfellows.com/">Kleiner Perkins Fellows</a>, <a href="http://www.baincapitalventures.com/startupacademy/">Bane's StartUp Academy</a>, <a href="http://nycturingfellows.org/">NYC Turing Fellows</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://interviewstreet.com">InterviewStreet</a> and <a href="http://internmatch.com">InternMatch</a>. None of these are a substitute for applying to companies individually (and I haven't tried them myself) but given the reasonably short time required to apply, they are probably worth doing.</li>
<li><strong>Location is a pretty big deal.</strong>&nbsp;Try to be in the Bay Area (Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Mountain View, Palo Alto, etc) if you can - <a href="http://alexeymk.com/the-bay-area-is-awesome">it's awesome</a>. and there are a ton of other interns around. &nbsp;I hear <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-12-09/tech/30449324_1_techstars-zocdoc-onswipe">New York</a> is getting pretty fun as well, but don't have any personal experience. Other tech regions like Boston or Austin (and maybe LA and Philly) aren't bad, but make sure not to get stuck in the middle of nowhere, living in the suburbs as the only tech intern at a huge company. &nbsp;That does not a fun summer make.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style="font-size: large;">2) How do I pick where to apply/work?</strong></p>
<p>Before applying, consider: "Am I excited about the products this company makes? Would I be excited to know that I work there?" It's much easier to get motivated (and show excitement) for a company you are excited about. I was Dropbox user #2001, which I did not neglect to mention when I applied. It helped. I think.</p>
<p>I strongly advice looking for internships with a big tech company or a startup, rather than a non-tech company (esp. financial) company that happens to have engineers. The explanation is a little long, so I'll just assume you nod along hummingly here. For the inquisitive:&nbsp;<a href="http://alexeymk.com/private/ysfskqeqtu">here's a longer argument</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Picking a startup</span><br /></strong>You want to work for (and learn from) the start-ups that are going to be successful, but as the Venture Capital industry knows <a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/small-business/small-business/pet-project-history-lessons-for-a-petfood-startup-1306600428322/?link=SM_smallbiz_featStory">full</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnet.com/1990-11136_1-6278387-1.html">well</a>, it's not always easy to pick winners.</p>
<p>There are, however, a few hints that you can pick up on and prioritize for when thinking about where to work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Has the founder had a successful start-up venture in the past</strong>? They must have done something right; past performance appears to be the best guarantor of success for tech enterpreneurs.</li>
<li><strong>Is the founder (or a large portion of the founding team) technical</strong>? Are they writing code? Do they come from a strong technical background, whether at a startup or from a top tech company?</li>
<li><strong>Does the company or its employees have a track record of being good mentors</strong>? &nbsp;I wrote a <a href="http://alexeymk.com/the-mentorship-test-9-questions-for-your-pote">Mentorship Checklist</a>: questions worth asking to find out.</li>
<li><strong>Is the company pre or post "<a href="http://thisisapipe.com/escape-startup-flatland/what-is-product-market-fit">product-market fit</a>?"</strong> &nbsp;That is, are they figuring out what the heck it is that they are going to do that makes money, or have they figured it out and are trying to scale and make sure the servers don't melt with all the new traffic? &nbsp;Both are exciting times in the life of a start-up; consider a pre-product market fit company if you're looking to get a big opportunity to contribute creatively and try new things, and a product-market fit company if you are interested in the technical challenge of quickly scaling a codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Is this a 'well known' startup?&nbsp;</strong>One of the downsides about working at a startup is that it doesn't usually yield the brand recognition of a 'Facebook' or a 'Google' on your resume. Working at a small company people have heard of (TechCrunch coverage/Twitter buzz being a reasonable proxy for 'heard of') helps negate that. Think (again) Quora, Path, Uber, Square, etc - small teams but well-known products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Picking between larger companies</span><br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way to figure out if a larger company is worth working for is by their reputation: ask upperclassmen, friends and professors. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Does the company have an official internship program? Does it sound awesome? Can you speak to somebody (ideally from your school, but from the company if not) who has been through the program as an intern? Talk about both intern housing and make sure to run through the Mentorship Checklist.</li>
<li>Sites like <a href="http://glassdoor.com">glassdoor.com</a>, which offer anonymous feedback from employees, a tremendously useful service as you try to figure out if this is one of those 'magical companies'. The sample size is not large enough to use for companies smaller than a few hundred employees, unfortunately.</li>
<li>It's not always immediately clear whether a company is or is not a 'tech company' - Amazon and Barnes and Noble both sell books online and have e-readers available, but (from my intuition) Amazon is a tech company that happens to sell books on-line, whereas B&amp;N is a book retailer that has been forced online and into e-readers by the prevailing winds of change. Which one sounds more fun to work at?</li>
<li>One sign of an innovative company is a technical or product person in the CEO role - think of Larry Page's involvement with Google products compared to somebody like Lowell McAdam (who?) at Verizon. &nbsp;It's more fun to work for a culture trying to build the future than one trying to maximize this quarter's revenues and '<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/11/28/maximizing-shareholder-value-the-dumbest-idea-in-the-world/">maximize shareholder value</a>.'</li>
<li>In general, newer companies will have less middle-management cruft and set-in-their-wayedness than older ones. &nbsp;There are some older companies with solid programs, like <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/">IBM's Extreme Blue</a>, and some&nbsp;newer companies with&nbsp;<a href="http://kotaku.com/5862913/nobody-likes-zynga">terrible reputations</a> I would advise against.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">3) What you learn</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>(or at least what I learned)</em></span></span></p>
<p>In short, working with top technical people will teach you software engineering 'done right' (IE, no more turning in ugly code for your homework assignment that is going to be auto-graded once and then filed away forever). That means different things at earlier and later stage companies, though, and I can only relate my experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>What I learned at Facebook<br /></strong></span>First and foremost, I learned to write 'good code'. My first non-trivial commit (15 lines or so) was rejected 6 or 7 times until I finally put the right amount of spacing in an "if (" and fixed my trailing whitespace. These were important, brilliant engineers politely telling an intern, time and time again, something that he should have found in the coding guidelines doc. I've been a little bit embarrased to show a lot of my pre-Facebook code, as a result - the improvement, at least for me, was significant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the experience taught me that Code is Culture. The fact that top FB engineers were willing to spend so much of their time on code reviews was a fantastic way to show-not-tell Facebook's commitment to good code. I can't say that I've been able to pay the overhead of 100% code reviews on every project or team I've worked on since, but having the background of working in a 'code quality matters' team has infused the way I think about programming today.</p>
<p>I also learned that engineers are not immune to politics, even at great companies. I was playing around with a hackathon improvement to one of the sharing features, but the engineer who understood most of the code would not reply to my emails for weeks and claimed he was busy (which he was) when I walked over to his desk. My original pitch for the feature I wanted to work on was "You know what sucks about Facebook? X. &nbsp;We should fix it." In retrospect, I did not do nearly a good enough job of trying to get the person on board or show respect for the work that had already been done.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>What I learned at 2bkco<br /></strong></span>I joined the team several weeks after the engineering work had begun. It was very humbling to see the ease with which <a href="http://hackerengineer.net">Eric</a>&nbsp;would put together a component and then decide, several days later, that there was a better way to do something and throw it all away. When you know your code has a good chance of being thrown away, the priority becomes writing quickly in a way that can be cleaned up later (which is different than writing sloppily or writing 'homework' code).</p>
<p>I also got a lot of training in breadth: 2bkco required me to be close-enough to fluent in Javascript (Coffeescript), Ruby on Rails and HTML/CSS. It was too early in the life of the company for me to specialize, which meant a lot of time on Google and StackOverflow, learning how to do a ton of things as I went. I became much more comfortable forking Github projects of things that did sort of what I wanted.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Fin.</span></strong></p>
<p>That's it. That's all I've got. Mostly. Comment with questions, or just <a href="http://twitter.com/alexeymk">tweet me, yo</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...I see you're still here. Alright.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: large;">PS. What about other types of internships/summer activities?</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PNNGb.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div>(<em>via&nbsp;<a href="http://twitpic.com/1ap8p5">Dave Miller</a></em>)</div>
<p>I spent the summer after my freshmen year doing all sorts of odd things, from playing a lot of Settler of Catan online to working in recruiting for my father, to travelling around in France. It was a mixed bag, unstructured in a way that (in retrospect) I found less than ideal.</p>
<p>There's nothing to say that working all three summers is strictly necessary, or that the two internship types I recommend are your best options (though I happen to think so). &nbsp;Here are some other options for either a third internship or an alternative to the first two, in something resembling-but-not-quite a ranked order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intern as a Product/Project Manager&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;A lot of larger companies offer these; though they require a technical background, day-to-day involves more management and product work than coding itself. &nbsp;Harder to get (as far as I know) than a software position, but worth trying if you are interested in that sort of thing. Google has a particularly prestigious&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/students/tech/internships/uscanada/associate-product-manager-intern-summer-mountain-view-1/index.html">APM</a>&nbsp;position that appears to be a blast from what I've heard.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong> - find a professor you like that is working on something cool and spend a summer in their lab. This doesn't pay quite as well as an internship but is worthwhile doing if you are considering getting a PhD and want to experience the research process first hand. &nbsp;This is also worth doing earlier in your undergraduate career, since the positions seems generally easier to get and the work you do will help with internships later on.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong> - consider applying for <a href="http://str8.to/google-summer-of-code">Google Summer of Code</a>&nbsp;or contributing to one of Apache's projects. Again, the pay (if you are in a structured program) isn't as great, but you still get to learn a ton from talented developers and get the feeling that you are contributing to something that a lot of people depend on. &nbsp;Again, having a substantial open source contribution is a great resume builder.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Freelance/own projects</strong>&nbsp;- If you've got the self-motivation and enough HTML/CSS/simple back-end skills, everybody and their mother seems to want a simple website built for a few hundred bucks. &nbsp;Spending a summer working on a lot of simpler projects is helpful if you're interested in learning the business side as well as pick up pretty good design skills - just make sure to be in an area with a designer/developer community, so you have more than the internet to rely on for finding clients and getting advice.</li>
<li><strong>Work for a small dev shop</strong> - A lot of higher-end freelance and consulting in the US is done by small freelance shops like ThoughtBot and (originally) 37Signals. A lot of innovation in software development (Ruby on Rails, for example) has come from shops like these. &nbsp;Plus, working on a lot of projects means a lot of breadth. The caveat is that the pay isn't as good, the deadlines are set in part by the client's needs, and there is less creativity on the product end.</li>
<li><strong>Non-technical internship (or travelling, or non-profit work) -</strong>&nbsp;These can be fun, but if you're looking for a career in tech, make sure that your non-technical internship is not done at the expense of getting enough coding experience by the time you graduate. &nbsp;Companies looking to hire you as an engineer will be far more interested in what coding work you've done than in anything not directly related.</li>
<li><strong>Tech internship at a non-tech company, especially in finance:</strong> Most of these will not pay as well and not (typically) have first-class engineers. Finance is an interesting case here: the pay can often be several times larger, if you are working on algorithmic or high-frequency trading (largely at smaller firms run by technical people). Still, in most finance firms, the traders are first-class; I've had some friends who have enjoyed their finance internships, but a lot have not. Buyer beware: the difference between a $5k and a $7k a month internship doesn't buy happiness.<p /></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KmpO1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Update - didn't do your undergrad in the US? You can still do an internship via a J-1 visa</em>. <a href="http://blog.jorilallo.com/post/17144715009/how-to-intern-in-silicon-valley-and-get-a-j1-visa">Jori explains.</a></p>
<p>In general, the situation is a bit of a mess. But: if you're studying in the US on an F-1 visa like I am, here's what I've learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>After you graduate, you are allowed up to 12 months of OPT to work in the US without needing an H1-B or similar visa, which is great because H1-Bs are non-trivial to get. &nbsp;You also get 17 months after that, via the STEM extension (ask your International Programs office). &nbsp;</li>
<li>There are two ways you can stay for an internship in the US in the summer: OPT (Optional Practical Training) and CPT (Curricular Practical Training).</li>
<li>Applying for OPT means you need to apply by February or March at the latest, and (eventually) have an offer letter from your company. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the time you take eats away from your post-graduation OPT allowance. &nbsp;Larger companies will be better suited than smaller ones for dealing with the paperwork that OPT entails.</li>
<li>Applying for CPT is much faster (the University, rather than the State Department, approves these), but CPT means that you're taking an independent study with a professor as part of your internship (for me, this meant writing weekly reports). It also means you're paying for your summer class, which cuts into your profit from the internship. &nbsp;It does not, however, cut into post-graduation OPT time. Speak to your department about precedents of CPT being done - generally, somebody will be familiar with the process.</li>
