          <p>“Alexey, do you feel the points you bring up during our post-mortems are productive?” my tech lead asked at our 1:1.</p>

<p>Well, shit. I had thought so, but apparently not.</p>

<p>Earlier in the year, I became the Engineering Manager on a team responsible for half of the outages at our 2,000 person company. After each incident, the on-call engineer would write-up a doc and schedule a meeting.</p>

<p>“How come this wasn’t caught in unit tests?” I found myself asking, in front of the assembled team. Next post-mortem, same thing. “I get that we didn’t have monitoring for this particular metric, but why not?” Week after week.</p>

<p>The tech lead had asked a great question. Was my approach working?</p>

<p>“I want to set high expectations,” I told him. “It’s not pleasant being critiqued in a group setting, but my hope is that the team internalizes my ‘good post-mortem’ bar.”</p>

<p>The words sounded wrong even as I said them.</p>

<p>“Thanks for the feedback.” I said “Let me think on it.”</p>

<h2 id="feedback-budgets">Feedback budgets</h2>
<p>I thought about it.</p>

<p>There’s a limited budget for criticism one can ingest productively in a single sitting. Managers will try to extend this budget through famed best-practices like the shit-sandwich and the not-really-a-question question. Employees learn these approaches over time and develop an immunity.</p>

<p>This happened here. Once my questioning reached the criticism threshold, I was no longer “improving the post-mortem culture.” I was “building resentment and defensiveness”.</p>

<p>I had run over budget. And yet, there was important feedback to give!</p>

<h2 id="change-the-template-change-the-world">Change the template, change the world</h2>
<p>Upon reflection, I ended up <a href="#post-mortem-changes">updating our post-mortem template</a>. My questions became part of the template that got filled in before meeting.</p>

<p>This way, it was the template pestering the post-mortem author. My role was simply to insist that the template be filled out; an entirely reasonable ask.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, this worked; post-mortems became more substantive. The team to pared down outage frequency and met OKR goals.</p>

<h2 id="process-linters">Process linters</h2>

<p>One Simple Trick I had stumbled into was that there was a way to get around feedback budgets.
Turns out there’s this other, vaster budget to tap into: the budget of process automation. When feedback is automated, it arrives sooner, feels confidential, and lacks judgement. This makes it palatable; this is why the budget is vaster.</p>

<p>The technical analogy here is how we use linters. “Nit: don’t forget to explicitly handle the return value” during code review feels mildly frustrating. Ugh. It’s “just a style thing” and “the code works”. I’ll make the change, but with slight resentment.</p>

<p>Yet, if that same “unhandled return value” nudge arrives in the form of a linter, it’s a different story. I got the feedback before submitting the code for review; no human had to see my minor incompetence.</p>

<p>As a software engineer, Have Good Linters is an obvious, uncontroversial best practice. The revelatory moment for me was that templates for documents were just another kind of linter.</p>

<h2 id="happy-ending">Happy Ending</h2>

<p>My insight completely transformed the way Opendoor Engineering thinks about feedback; I crowd-surfed, held aloft by the team’s grateful arms, to receive my due praise as the master of all process improvement.</p>

<p>Just kidding; COVID-19 happened and I switched jobs.</p>

<h3 id="the-appendices-three">The Appendices Three</h3>
<h4 id="i-process-linters-seen-in-the-wild">I: Process linters seen in the wild</h4>

<h5 id="meetings">Meetings</h5>
<p>Feedback “we have too many meetings”; “what’s the point of this meeting”; “do I need to be here”
Linter mandate no-meetings days; mandate agendas; mandate a hard max on attendee count.</p>

<h5 id="progress-updates">Progress Updates</h5>
<p>Feedback “Hey, how’s that project going? Haven’t heard from you in a bit”
Linter Daily stand-ups (synchronous or in slack/an app); issue trackers (Linear, Asana, Jira, Trello)</p>

<h5 id="bug-reports">Bug Reports</h5>
<p>Feedback “Hey, a friend who uses the app said that our unsubscribe page is broken?”
Linter Quality pre-deploy test coverage, automated error reporting (Sentry), Alerting on pages or business metrics having anomalous activity patterns (Datadog).</p>

<h4 id="ii-youve-gone-too-far-with-this-process-crap">II: You’ve gone too far with this process crap</h4>

<p>The process budget is vaster than the feedback budget, but it isn’t unlimited. A mature company is going to have lots of legacy process - process debt, if you will.</p>

<p>Process requires maintenance and pruning, to avoid “we do this because we’ve always done this” type problems. High-process managers are just as likely to generate unhappy employees as high-feedback managers.</p>

<h4 id="iii-the-post-mortem-template-changes-if-thats-what-youre-here-for">III: The post-mortem template changes, if that’s what you’re here for</h4>

<h5 id="a-5-whys-prompts">A. “5 Whys” Prompts</h5>
<p>Our original 5 Whys prompt was “Why did this outage occur.”  During the post-mortem review, I kept asking questions like “but why didn’t this get caught in regression testing?”</p>

<p>So, after discussion, I added my evergreen questions to the post-mortem template. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why didn’t the issue get caught by unit tests?</li>
  <li>Why didn’t the issue get caught by integration/smoke tests?</li>
  <li>Why didn’t the issue get flagged in Code Review?</li>
  <li>Why didn’t the issue get caught during manual QA?</li>
  <li>If the outage took over an hour to get discovered, why didn’t the monitoring page our on-call?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="b-defining-root-cause">B. Defining “Root Cause”</h5>
<p>“5 Whys” recommends continuing to ask why until you’re about five levels deep. We were often stopping at one or two.</p>

<p>To make stopping less ambiguous, here are a set of “root causes” that I think are close to exhaustive:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>trade-off</strong> we were aware of this concern but explicitly made the speed-vs-quality trade-off (IE, not adding tests for an experiment). This was tech debt coming back to bite us.</li>
  <li><strong>knowledge gap</strong> the person doing the work was not aware that this kind of error was even possible (IE, tricky race conditions, worker starvation)</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>brain fart</strong> now that we look at it, we should have caught this earlier. “Just didn’t get enough sleep that night” kind of thing.</p>

    <p>If you keep asking “why” but haven’t gotten to an answer that boils down to one of these, keep going deeper (or get a second opinion).</p>
  </li>

<p>Working remotely: not just for COVID-19 anymore.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.themarketingstudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chasm-adoption-lifecycle.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>From academia to the Open Source movement, remote collaboration is not exactly novel. From Github to DuckDuckGo, remote-first successful businesses are no longer rare.</p>

<p>Remote work occupied the cultural relevance of <em>something those whiz kids do, working on a beach in Thailand</em>. Until today.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUt3QiFWEAA9DmH?format=jpg&amp;name=small" alt="Actually, we took this photo in Vietnam. Hi Luka!" /></p>

<h3 id="what-has-prevented-remote-work-adoption">What has prevented remote work adoption?</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Inertia</strong>. I have a job and a system that “works” for me. Don’t change what isn’t broken.</li>
  <li><strong>Status</strong>. I have a “real job” at a “real company.” Working remote is for weirdos and loners.</li>
  <li><strong>Productivity</strong>. Real decisions happen in elevators on the way to lunch. We know how to be efficient and innovative in-person. How the hell do you build a team remotely?</li>
</ol>

<p>COVID-19 addressed <strong>inertia</strong>. Twitter, a Legitimate Tech Company™️, addressed <strong>status</strong>. Productivity is still pretty hit-or-miss, but it’s early days yet.</p>

<h2 id="trust-me-im-an-expert-guinea-pig">Trust me, I’m an <del>expert</del> guinea pig</h2>

<p>I came to the Bay Area like a moth to the flame of start-ups after college.</p>

<p>Lacking an H-1B, I left in 2014, and started <a href="https://www.hackerparadise.org/">Hacker Paradise</a>, a boutique travel business catered to remote workers. During that time, I worked remotely as a software engineer for <a href="https://www.binti.com">an SF client</a> for over a year.</p>

<p>In 2016, I came back to San Francisco. I did it for the same reason I came in the first place - the quality of the jobs and the community.</p>

<p>I don’t love working remotely. I miss the energy I get from a well-run office environment. COVID-19 has taught me that I’m an extrovert, and shelter-in-place has sucked.</p>

<p>And yet.</p>

<h4 id="1-remote-work-is-about-to-do-to-san-francisco-what-san-francisco-did-to-the-south-bay">1. Remote work is about to do to San Francisco what San Francisco did to the South Bay.</h4>

<p>Techies have been leaving San Francisco for cities like Portland, Austin, Denver and Seattle (PADS) for over a decade. We seek a place to settle down and improve cost-to-quality-of-life ratio.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/d6c879ffa3d044f8.jpg?w=720&amp;h=540" alt="This is how you know they appreciate us." /></p>

<p>As it becomes easier than ever to keep your job while moving, this trend will pick up. The microkitchens at Twitter are nice, but not “an extra $2k/mo in rent” nice.</p>

<p>As ambitious millennials realize they can optimize for quality of life, expect businesses like Culdesac and Hacker Paradise (see what I did there) to blossom.</p>

<p>San Francisco will neither be abandoned quickly nor completely. It’ll retain a “city emeritus”  status, like London, Philadelphia or Palo Alto.</p>

<h4 id="2-were-going-to-learn-to-run-remote-organizations">2. We’re going to learn to run remote organizations.</h4>

<p>We are, as an industry, pretty clueless at remote company building.</p>

<p>In fairness, we’re not even that good at regular company building. We just figured out 1:1s were a good idea and are still deciding who dotted-lines to whom in the matrix org structure.</p>

<p>You can’t just slap “remote friendly” on your jobs page and decide you’ve done a “heck of a job.”</p>

<p>Should team sizes change? How to you measure and manage morale? What about onboarding and knowledge sharing?</p>

<p>There’s some knowledge to be gleaned from the Basecamp folks; they <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/remote">wrote a book</a> about remote work. That book is the COBOL of remote work; it works, but we can do better.</p>

<h4 id="3-were-about-to-enter-a-renaissance-in-remote-collaboration-tooling">3. We’re about to enter a renaissance in remote collaboration tooling.</h4>

<p>Slack is <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1243000487365861376.html">doing phenomenally well</a> during COVID-19, but it still kind of sucks, right? At least when people emailed you, they didn’t expect a response right away. Etiquette around Slack usage is still pretty immature, am I right <strong>@channel</strong>?</p>

<p>Also. Software engineers use Github, and it’s a pretty mature way to collaborate on shared work. Every other industry is still sending around <code class="highlighter-rouge">Presentation Final Final [2].pdf</code>. Some of my favorite former co-workers are building companies in this space. expect more businesses like Figma and Loom to blossom.</p>

<h2 id="ps-youre-wrong-alexey-offices-are-here-to-stay">PS. You’re wrong, Alexey. Offices are here to stay.</h2>

<p>That’s true. They will.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The move to remote-as-mainstream-option will take a good decade or two. The inflection point, however, was today, on May 12, 2020.</p>

<p>I for one look forward to kids asking what it was like when I had to <strong>leave</strong> for work <strong>every day</strong>.</p>

<p>The year was 2013, Meteor was the hip new kid on the block and Coffeescript was a reasonable JS dialect choice. We were fresh out of college.  Meteor was hosting their first ‘Summer Hackathon’ in San Francisco on 10th and Minna, and we figured this was our shot.</p>

<p>Sequestering ourselves on the second floor of the hackspace, a couple of college friends and I acquired a whiteboard and some markers, and jotted down our big idea list. Not lacking for ambition, the first thing we figured we would fix was server-side rendering. Turned out this <em>seemingly simple</em> task was already on Meteor’s <a href="https://trello.com/c/Lz07fBAm/7-server-side-rendering">Trello Roadmap</a>, so, what the heck, we figured we’d pitch in.</p>

<p><img src="/images/server-side-rendering.gif" alt="I inquire about server-side rendering" /></p>

<p>Speaking with the actual development team a few hours later, we learned that server side was (1) hard and (2) coming soon anyway<sup id="fnref:ssr" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ssr" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Fair enough - we’d solve our other painpoint, the lack of a proper admin DSL.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-introducing-z-the-mongo-admin">Part 1: introducing Z, the Mongo Admin</h2>
<p>Coming from Django land, one of my favorite Framework features had always been being able to describe Admin UIs with a very high level DSL - stuff like</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">models</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Author</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CharField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CharField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>leading to auto-generated pages that look like:</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/_images/list_filter.png" alt="django admin screenshot, from tutorial" /></p>

<p>Meteor didn’t have an admin DSL<sup id="fnref:genghis" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:genghis" class="footnote">2</a></sup> yet. I wanted very much to build one, and a zero-config one (IE, automatically discover your models) at that. I kept suggesting this idea until the others agreed. Leadership.</p>

<p>We cranked out a desired feature-list on a whiteboard. It looked like this.</p>

<h4 id="the-list">The List</h4>

<ul>
  <li>document view</li>
  <li>dealing with arrays</li>
  <li>dealing with nested objects</li>
  <li>boolean fields</li>
  <li>integer fields</li>
  <li>editing</li>
  <li>auto-discovery &amp; Schema</li>
  <li>collection (table) view</li>
  <li>home page view</li>
  <li>doesn’t look terrible</li>
  <li>wrapping the admin into a package.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then we got started. I hid in a corner and tried to figure out how to get a list of Collections, and the fields in each collection, out of an arbitrary Meteor app. It turned out there was no official way but if I poked under the covers of the undocumented <code class="highlighter-rouge">Meteor._RemoteCollectionDriver.mongo.db.collections</code> call.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AlexeyMK/84ed89aaa30da0aea9170974f038955e.js"></script>

<p>It turned out you had to ‘warm up’ the _RemoteCollectionDriver (by creating an arbitrary collection) to get the collections loaded. This was the way things worked around Meteor 0.6.</p>

<p>Package loading was the other relatively painful thing - since we couldn’t figure out <em>quite</em> how to get our package loaded last (since we relied on a router and a number of other packages), Yefim solved the problem the pragmatic Hackathon way, and named the package Z-Meteor Admin. This way, unless we relied on a package that decided to start with two Z’s, Meteor would load us last.</p>

<h4 id="launching-with-the-mvp">Launching with the MVP</h4>
<p>Surprisingly, it kind of worked.</p>

<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2b2811cfc1308e19f99a3b31bf2b9b8d9b4dd008/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f67746572726f6e6f2f6d6574656f722d61646d696e2d75692f6d61737465722f646f632f636f6c6c656374696f6e2e706e67" alt="an early version of the UI" /></p>

<p>We demoed at the Hackathon and even <a href="https://blog.meteor.com/congratulations-to-the-meteor-summer-hackathon-2013-teams-c2ec782e9b53">won the ‘Award for Most Technically Impressive’</a>.</p>

<p>Greg and I kept working on the project throughout the summer and fall of 2013. We cleaned it up and released 1.0 in December 2013, after gaining over 200 stars on Github.</p>

<p>For our 1.0 release, I demoed a slightly-less-hacky-and-<a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues/37">now-renamed</a> Houston Admin at Meteor Devshop 10:</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8ASwWEZsAog" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Here’s <a href="http://alexeymk.com/2013/12/19/houston-admin-talk-at-meteor-devshop-10.html">the blog post</a> I wrote to celebrate the event.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-a-primer-on-gas-tank-emptying">Part 2: A primer on gas tank emptying</h2>

<p>Between the 1.0 in December 2013 and roughly summer 2014, our enthusiasm for working on the project waned. There were many reasons, but here are some:</p>

<h4 id="1-we-had-shit-to-do">1. We had shit to do.</h4>
<p>Greg finished school and was working for Gumroad, not in Meteor.
I was doing consulting/startup prototyping work, also mostly not in Meteor.
Yefim &amp; Ceasar made the wise decision of not doing much contributing work past the initial release.</p>

<h4 id="2-we-were-no-longer-scratching-our-own-itch">2. We were no longer scratching our own itch.</h4>
<p>Originally, Yefim and I used Houston for the Intern Dinners we were running that summer. It was pretty helpful, and if we needed more UI stuff, we’d just add it. That was summer 2013.</p>

<p>Even though many of the feature requests we were getting were quite sensible (and we implemented a bunch of them), we really weren’t scratching our own itch after summer 2013.</p>

<h4 id="3-how-do-i-even-esque-github-issues">3. ‘How do I even’-esque Github Issues</h4>
<p>Actually, having gone through some of the ~270 <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues">Github Issues</a> on the project, I’m surprised by how good many of them were and how attentive and friendly we were about them. Still, there were a few bad apples, like <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues/216">css not rendering</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues/274">how to upload files</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues/301">Cannot login on Heroku app</a> that either failed to provide enough context and/or were coming from folks who were not otherwise yet competent Meteor (or even JS) developers.</p>

<h4 id="4-meteor-doesnt-support-mounting--hacky-css">4. Meteor doesn’t support Mounting &amp; hacky CSS.</h4>
<p>Meteor bundles all CSS &amp; Javascript together when it compiles. This is not the ideal behavior for UI libraries, since if the parent app has some logic that say, for example <code class="highlighter-rouge">$('.save').disable()</code> and later the user goes to Houston, all of a sudden all of our ‘save’ buttons are disabled and its unclear why. Likewise, any global CSS rules the parent app chooses to use, like (say) making table columns 200 pixels high, will also make our table columns 200 pixels high. Greg did <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues/172">some crazy things</a> to avoid the namespace collissions.</p>

<p>Django solves this problem through <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/urls/#url-namespaces">URL namespaces</a>, allowing the ‘admin’ to behave largely like its own app. Express.js allows for <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html">‘mounting’</a> of multiple sub-apps on certain directory paths - in either case, no shared CSS/JS is bundled for these cases, avoiding collissions like the above.</p>

<p>Meteor did not support Mounting out of the box. I bugged the devs about it at a later Devshop, and got an off-hand note that this was not a priority for now. Later on we tried to add Mounting to Meteor and/or host the Admin as a separate app that shared only the database with the parent app, but by then lacked the enthusiasm to bring the projects to completion.</p>

<h4 id="5-testing-is-tough">5. Testing is tough!</h4>
<p>Reactive apps with not a ton of business logic are <em>tough</em> to test! Perhaps we simply lacked the experience here, but when Greg and I tried to add proper integration tests to the app, we spent tens of hours being our heads against the wall, time that would have been better spent actually fixing bugs.</p>

<h4 id="6-router-wars">6. Router Wars</h4>
<p>When we created Houston in summer 2013, there was a router that I believe was just called Router. Later, Iron-Router becames the default router (perhaps this was a rename?) - and even later, Flow-Router became the preferred router. Here’s <a href="https://kadira.io/blog/meteor/flow-router-4-0-and-future-of-routing-in-meteor">a post</a> on the state of routing as of Summer 2015.</p>

<p>The point was, you couldn’t really use both routers and so we would need lots of clever work to see if we could support both paths.  We discussed this in <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues/294">a Github Issue</a> and I <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/pull/343">wrote up a prototype</a> but ultimately just didn’t have enough time/energy to ship a supports-both solution.</p>

<h4 id="7-when-undocumented-internal-dependencies-change">7. When Undocumented Internal Dependencies Change</h4>
<p>Remember that <code class="highlighter-rouge">_RemoteCollectionDriver</code> hack? In most every release (0.7, 0.8) my ‘whatever, go ask mongo what collections there are’ hack kept breaking and I had to re-implement a new hack based on whichever refactor the Meteor Development Group implemented internally.</p>

<p>Not particularly taxing, but just a drain.</p>

<h4 id="8-we-never-stepped-back-and-thought-about-architecture">8. We never stepped back and thought about architecture.</h4>
<p>Things were in slighly better shape than they were back during the hackathon, but there was never a “how should this package be properly architected” conversation. As a result, in later months as I tried to go back and implement changes, it was never clear to me what was where or why, or what edge cases I would need to consider and support. This made “weekend-a-month” type support less useful over time as I knew the codebase less and less well.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-where-we-go-to-costa-rica-and-try-to-turn-things-around">Part 3: Where we go to Costa Rica and try to turn things around</h2>

<h4 id="costa-rica-the-plan">Costa Rica: the plan</h4>

<p>Around Summer 2014, a year after we started, things were going kind of slumpey. As an effort to regroup, I invited Greg to Costa Rica where I was staying for a few months:
<img src="/images/costa-rica-summit.gif" alt="Hey Greg, come to Costa Rica!" /></p>

<p>The plan was basically to unbreak the critical stuff and make a plan for what we wanted to do next, and maybe also play some soccer on the beach.</p>

<h4 id="costa-rica-what-actually-happened">Costa Rica: what actually happened</h4>
<p>I got bogged down on a consulting project that was a bit behind schedule as Greg visited. So we got maybe 1-2 days of work done, which instead of dealing with any of the issues on my part was shipping a new feature I decided I wanted, called <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston#custom-actions">Custom Actions</a>, which were kind of cool but not at all the problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dbf805a68e8d8ea7e5afa28ad991035ae97530d7/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f67746572726f6e6f2f686f7573746f6e2f6d61737465722f646f632f637573746f6d2d616374696f6e732e706e67" alt="Custom Actions" /></p>

<p>We still played some soccer, though. Greg was way better at soccer than the rest of us.</p>

<h4 id="get-other-maintainers-they-said">Get other maintainers, they said</h4>
<p>We had two pretty helpful maintainers turn up: First, <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/commits?author=zurawiki">Roger</a> decided to redesign our UI from basic boostrap to the line-green version you see today. Second, sometime around late 2014, this Swiss dude named <a href="https://github.com/matteodem">Matteo</a> showed up and <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues/251">fixed</a> a bunch of things. That was awesome, and we talked to him on Skype and gave him write access as somebody had suggested for growing your maintainers.</p>

<p>Later, in 2015, my friend <a href="https://github.com/samcorcos">Sam</a> came in and added some proper tests, but development had largely ceased by then.</p>

<p>Still, for whatever reason, nobody stuck around and answered issues, etc, for the long term, so it was still up to us.</p>

<h2 id="part-4-decline-and-fall-of-the-houston-admin">Part 4: Decline and Fall of the Houston Admin</h2>

<h4 id="meteor-10-is-released">Meteor 1.0 is released!</h4>
<p>Coinciding with Greg’s visit, Meteor finally <a href="https://blog.meteor.com/meteor-1-0-d0702aab3ef">released 1.0</a> in October 2014. Perhaps we’ll no longer have to adjust the incompatible hacks we use to figure out which collections are to be added and we can focus on the good stuff!</p>

<h4 id="blaze-vs-react">Blaze vs React</h4>
<p>If only. A year later, the big question up in the air becomes whether to use Meteor’s original Blaze templating or <a href="https://www.discovermeteor.com/blog/blaze-react-meteor/">switch to a react-based front-end</a>. React is great and all, but we for one are not up for yet anothe rewrite of this thing we haven’t really gotten to use for our own stuff in like, two years.</p>

<h4 id="13">1.3</h4>
<p>To add insult to injury, The Meteor Development Group ignores the principles of <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> to release 1.3 in April 2016 with <a href="https://guide.meteor.com/1.3-migration.html">Breaking Changes</a> - and our package is <a href="https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues/372">broken yet again. Maybe.</a></p>

<h2 id="part-5-an-epilogue">Part 5, an Epilogue</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most poignant symptom of the sort of stagnancy that the project fell into is that I had an idea to write this blog-post in early 2015, and it took two years to even get the post-mortem for this project done.</p>

<p>I think Greg may have fixed the 1.3 issue, but the last change I can see in the codebase is in March 2016 and frankly I just don’t care anymore. On the bright side, it looks like there’s a <a href="https://github.com/yogiben/meteor-admin">half-decent competitor</a> that people who want an admin can use<sup id="fnref:yogiben" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yogiben" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Also, the Meteor Development Group looks like it’s less interested in Meteor and focusing on <a href="http://www.apollodata.com/">GraphQL tools</a> these days, so maybe nobody needs this. On the bright side, 880 stars on Github, so that’s cool!</p>

<h4 id="what-have-we-learned">What have we learned?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Open-source maintenance is hard, especially if your only remaining motivation is altruism. <a href="https://twitter.com/schneems">Richard Schneeman</a> gave a great talk about <a href="https://www.schneems.com/2016/05/31/saving-sprockets.html">Saving Sprockets</a> last year which nailed it.</li>
  <li>Perhaps we should have quit while we were ahead and put an “not actively maintained, looking for maintainers” on the README back in 2014. That would have been a bit more responsible.</li>
  <li>On the bright side, building a key piece of infrastructure for a hip new development framework turned out to be a great way to get a lot of users for your open source project.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="one-more-thing">…one more thing</h4>
<p>I leave you with the contributions over time graph, which tells the whole story, but with graphics.
<img src="/images/contributions.gif" alt="contributions over time" /></p>

<h4 id="thank-you">Thank you</h4>

<ul>
  <li>To Greg, the prospect of collaborating with whom kept me in the project as long as it did.</li>
  <li>The Yefim, Ceasar, Matteo, Roger, Sam and other contributors!</li>
  <li>The the Meteor Development Group folks for their contributions to realtime web development, whose ideas will live on independent of Meteor’s future, and also for the free snacks and t-shirts and the Pebbles we won at that hackathon back at 2013.</li>

          <p>For most<sup id="fnref:tdd" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:tdd" class="footnote">1</a></sup> engineering tasks, I prefer to avoid TDD, or Test Driven Development.</p>

<p>Yet when I job-hunt, I use TDD religiously<sup id="fnref:coding" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:coding" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. It has been tremendously helpful.</p>

<h4 id="hmpf-why">Hmpf. Why?</h4>
<p>Most interview challenges actually come in two parts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can you take a broadly-worded problem and nail it down into something unambiguous?</li>
  <li>Can you implement a challenging but unambiguous spec in the allotted time?</li>
</ol>

<p>TDD forces you into the ideal mindset for nailing down (1) problem definitions. There’s no better way to properly grok a problem than to have to think through all the fun ways an implementation could be slightly off.</p>

<p>The implementation itself (2) also gets easier since you no longer have to assume that your code “probably” works, or fiddle with a REPL each time you’re ready to check.</p>

<h4 id="so-how-do-i-do-it">So how do I do it?</h4>
<p>As soon as you hear the problem, resist the urge to rush straight to the solution.</p>

<p>Instead, force yourself to fully think through the test cases for an <em>arbitrary implementation</em>. Make it a dialog - “what if the same element is in the array multiple times?” Get the interviewer engaged. Show you care.</p>

<p>By the time you’ve written good tests and the interviewer agrees, you’re all set.  Even though you tried not to, you probably already have a decent solution in mind. Your tests will let you know you’re done. They’ll also give you the comfort that your subsequent clean up / refactoring doesn’t inadvertantly break your implemenation.</p>

<h4 id="yeah-but-i-can-always-just-write-tests-later">Yeah, but I can always just write tests later.</h4>
<p>When I conduct interviews, I keep running into candidates clever enough to power through engineering challenges on raw talent<sup id="fnref:smarter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:smarter" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. The candidate implements an <em>optimal</em> solution within fifteen minutes. Then it’s time for tests and she just <strong>cannot</strong> think of cases beyond the common path, which makes her look like <a href="http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/best-team-tactics-to-write-software/">a cowboy</a>.</p>

<p>I blame the <a href="https://hbr.org/2006/12/the-curse-of-knowledge;at/1">curse of knowledge</a> - once you’ve solved the problem, it’s harder to think about what wrong turns you could have taken. It all feels trivial.</p>

<h4 id="seriously-though-are-you-going-to-make-me-import-a-testing-framework-like-mocha-or-cucumber-ugh">Seriously though, are you going to make me import a testing framework? Like, Mocha or Cucumber? Ugh.</h4>

<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯, I just use asserts and print statements. If I’m feeling fancy, I’ll create an array of test case scenarios and run them like</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>test_cases = [

<p>If you insist on being fancy, you can do that thing where you ask your interviewer if they’d like you to use a proper testing framework first, and of course they don’t, but now it looks like you <em>could</em> and you’re just doing them a favor by using asserts, cause you’re like, super assertive.</p>

Plus, there’s a decent chance you’ll run into me on your phone screen and we can have that awkward interaction of trying to figure out why my name sounds familiar.</p>

          <p>2015 and 2016 could not have been more different.</p>

<p><strong>2015</strong> was mostly spent living out of a carry-on bag, traveling from Estonia and Berlin to Tokyo and Taipei helping run trips for, and building, <a href="http://hackerparadise.org">Hacker Paradise</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bicycle_trip.jpg" style="max-width: 100%  !important;" /></p>

<p>It was great. Wanderlust: satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>2016</strong> found me receiving an H1-B visa, moving back to the Bay Area, and obtaining honest-to-goodness employment. Different.</p>

<p>Here’s how becoming sedentary and employed has turned out so far, relative to expectations.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>Basically, stability.</p>

<h3 id="engaged">Engaged</h3>
<p>My partner Mari<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and I are (at long last) engaged! After 5 years of being together, we’re back to living together and have a place in Bernal Heights that feels like our own. We’re so domestic we even got an L-shaped couch and the kind of mattress they advertise on podcasts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/casper.png" /></p>

<p>There’s something very warm and comforting in having a good sense of who you are going to spend the rest of your life with. Mari has been an anchor, making the disruption in other parts of my life that much more manageable.</p>

<h3 id="friendship--community">Friendship &amp; Community</h3>
<p>It’s also been rewarding to be able to engage and re-engage in meaningful friendships. One of the toughest parts of traveling full-time turned out to be meeting new people every month (great people, mind you) and forging friendships with them. At some point, the task became exhausting. I yearned for the comfort of spending time with the sort of friend that already knew my jokes were overly-complicated and terrible and would laugh anyway, if only on the inside.</p>

<p>I’m still not 100% back to feeling integrated or satisfied with the depth of my relationships back in San Francisco, but compared to full-time travel, the improvement has been remarkable and the last few months of 2016 felt much better than the months prior.</p>

<h3 id="job">J.O.B.</h3>
<p>I joined <a href="https://opendoor.com/?src=alexey">Opendoor</a> in September. Part of the motivation of being an employee was to have co-workers I would learn from &amp; enjoy working with. This came true.  Another part, which I was more surprised to learn, was that “Growth Engineering” - a term I would have thought ridiculous back in college, and as a sell-out-sort-of-a-thing-to-do, is actually quite engaging and satisfying.  It feels like I’m doing behavioral economics research again, but with higher stakes. I’m very grateful to <a href="https://twitter.com/remis">Remi Gabillet</a>, for first identifying this role for me.</p>

<p>Opendoor has easily met expectations in terms of the company’s growth, the quality of my coworkers, my faith in the executive team, and my ability to have an impact as an individual contributor joining a 150+ person company.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>There’s no better crutch for procrastination than employment.</p>

<h3 id="balance">Balance</h3>
<p>A problem that I’ve seen a fair bit with engineers and especially founders in tech is this mission-at-all-costs mentality. Like political operatives on a critical campaign or soldiers in the middle of a war, it’s easy to say “this thing I’m part of is more important. I can postpone [personal thing that I should get done] for now, because if we win we can always deal with it later.”</p>

<p>And then the mission comes to an end and we’re stuck figuring out that we’ve got to find a way to do our own laundry and maybe go to the gym more often and our last annual check-up was in the last decade. Maybe you deal with it, but often you start hoping and searching for another mission to come along because it’s easier and you don’t have to do boring, mundane things like take care of yourself.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for deciding to get a job rather than starting another company was that I could use the superior work-life balance to get the rest of my shit in order, and avoid getting caught in the mission-at-all-costs mentality.</p>

<p>That hasn’t really happened.</p>

<p>It did, a little bit, at Sprig. But at Opendoor, working harder and staying longer has been too gratifying, too tempting to be easily avoided, and I found myself slowly falling back into using mission-at-all-costs excuses<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
<p>As a result, I’ve definitely gained some weight (something that did not happen while traveling and eating at restaurants full-time for a year and a half). I’ve ignored a doctor’s note to start watching my cholesterol. I missed a dentist appointment. I bike to work but have failed to follow a regular gym schedule.</p>

<p>I also have yet to deal with setting up some nuances relating to my Health Savings Account. I have an accident claim from a rental car that got broken into that has been pending since September.</p>

<p>I planned to set concrete mental health goals around building resilience and good habits, and meet with a therapist regularly<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Still TBD.</p>

<p>Instead, I’ve reverted to occasionally staying up way later than I should and then being less productive at work the next day - essentially a high-school version of myself but with more severe impact to my productivity, given I’m not sixteen anymore.</p>

<p>My lifestyle has me eating less healthily and drinking more than when I was traveling, on “vacation”.</p>

<p>I find myself easily falling into many of the typical privileged-engineer-at-a-legit-startup-in-the-bay-area traps. It’s funny but also a little disappointing, since I was well aware of (and caution others) against this kind of self-neglect. I’d rather be making <em>new</em> mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="all-in-all">All in all</h2>
<p>Some good, some bad.  As far as new year’s resolutions go, I’m going to need to make sure to be hitting the original goals I had in mind when I moved back to San Francisco.</p>

<h2 id="2017-goals">2017 Goals</h2>

<p><strong>Sleep</strong>
Maintain a healthy sleep schedule (7+ hours of sleep and in bed by 1AM, 95% of the days of the year).</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong> Do something (bouldering, gym, or other form of exerfise) 3+ days a week, 95% of weeks except vacation. Reach and maintain target weight of around 10 pounds less than Jan 1st, 2016.</p>

<p><strong>Mental Health</strong> Build mental resilience (either follow a book or hire a therapist by Jan 30; create a growth plan; follow said plan).</p>

<p><strong>Physical Health</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Schedule &amp; attend follow-up physical by Jan 30; follow recommendations.</li>
  <li>Schedule &amp; attend dentist appointment by Feb 30.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Writing (AKA, other interests)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Publish a 500+ word piece once a month, including receiving quality feedback from friends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fingers crossed.</p>

      <p>I have to say I’m pretty stoked to stop explaining why I use “partner” and just saying “fiancee”. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>I assume that by 2017 this is not a controversial position. To be explicit: I’m not in any particular trouble, other than the sort of typical garden-variety depression and anxiety you’ll often see in ambitious over-achievers. You don’t wait until you’re overweight to start exercising; you shouldn’t wait to be struggling emotionally to work with a professional to build resilience and maintain mental health. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
