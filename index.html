          <p>Two steps forward, two steps back: 2016 in review.</p>

<p>I spent most of 2015 living out of a carry-on bag, traveling from Estonia and Berlin to Tokyo and Taipei helping run trips for, and building, Hacker Paradise.</p>

<p>It was great. That said, one year was plenty. After getting an H1-B visa, I moved back to the Bay Area in April 2016 and decided to get a job.</p>

<p>2015 and 2016 ended up as stark contrasts; here's how becoming sedentary and employed has turned out so far, relative to expectations.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>Basically, stability.</p>

<h3>Engaged</h3>

<p>My partner and I are (at long last) engaged! After 5 years of being together, we're back to living together and have a place in Bernal Heights that feels like our own. We're so domestic we even got an Ikea couch and a Casper-esque mattress. There's something very warm and comforting in having a good sense of whom you are going to spend the rest of your life with. Mari is like an anchor that  makes disruption in other parts of your life easier to handle.</p>

<h3>Friendship &amp; Community</h3>

<p>It's also been rewarding to be able to engage and re-engage in meaningful friendships. One of the toughest parts of traveling with Hacker Paradise had been meeting new people every month (great people, mind you) and forging friendships with them. At some point the task becomes exhausting and you yearn for the comfort of existing friendships where you don't need to provide context for your jokes and are largely accepted, quirks and all.</p>

<p>Part of the motivation for coming back was to return to my existing friends and spend more time with them, without the fear that in a few weeks we're going to go our own ways. I'm still not 100% back to feeling integrated or satisfied with the depth of my relationships, but compared to full-time travel the improvement has been remarkable and the last few months of 2016 felt much better than when we had just moved back.</p>

<h3>J.O.B.</h3>

<p>After a brief stint at Sprig, I ended up joining Opendoor in September. Part of the motivation of being an employee was to have co-workers I would learn from &amp; enjoy working with. This came true.  Another part, which I was more suprised to learn, was that "Growth Engineering" - a term I would have thought ridiculous back in college, and as a sell-out-sort-of-a-thing-to-do, is actually quite engaging and satisfying. I'm very pleased to have discovered a role outside of doing pure engineering or product work where interdisciplinary skills are such a strong asset. It feels like I'm doing behavioral economics research again, but with higher stakes. I'm very greatful to Remi Gabillet, my manager from Sprig, for seeing that this kind of role would fit well for me.</p>

<p>Opendoor has easily met expectations in terms of the company's growth, my faith in management and the executive team, and my ability to have an impact as an individual contributor joining a 150+ person company.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>There's no better crutch for procrastination then employment.  A problem that I see a lot of engineers and founders in tech can have is this mission-at-all-costs mentality; like political operatives on a critical campaign or soldiers in the middle of a war, it's easy to say "this thing I'm part of is more important. I can postpone [personal thing that I should get done] for now, because if we win we can always deal with it later." And then the  mission comes to an end and we're sort of stuck figuring out that we've got to find a way to do our own laundry and maybe go to the gym more often and make sure we have the proper healthcare.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for deciding to get a job rather than starting another company was that I could use the superior work-life balance to get the rest of my shit in order, and pull back no the mission mentality.</p>

<p>That hasn't really happened. It did, a little bit, at Sprig. But at Opendoor, working harder, staying longer, has been too easy and too rewarding to be easily avoided, and I fall back into using mission excuses.</p>

<p>As a result, I've definitely gained some weight (something that did not happen while traveling and eating at restaurants full-time for a year and a half). I've ignored a doctor's note to start watching my cholestorol. I missed a dentist appointment. I bike to work but don't have a regular gym schedule.</p>

<p>I also have yet to deal with setting up some nuances relating to my Health Savings Account. I have an accident claim from a rental car that got broken into that is still open since September.</p>

<p>I planned to set concrete mental health goals around building perseverance and good habits, and start seeing a therapist regularly. That hasn't happened.</p>

<p>Instead, I've reverted to occassionally staying up way later than I should and then being less productive at work the next day - essentially a high-school version of myself but with more severe impact to my productivity, given I'm not sixteen anymore.</p>

<p>I consume more alcohol on a weekly basis than I did while traveling (San Francisco, you cray!).  I spend more on rent than I used to on everything.</p>

<p>Basically I find myself easily falling into many of the typical priveleged-engineer-at-legit-startup-in-bay-area traps. It's funny but also a little dissapointing, since I was well aware of (and caution others) against this kind of self-neglect. It would be more productive to be making <em>new</em> mistakes.</p>

<h2>All in all</h2>

<p>Some good, some bad.  As far as new year's resolutions go, I'm going to need to make sure to be hitting my original goals.</p>

<h2>2017 Goals:</h2>

<p><em>Sleep</em> Maintain a healthy sleep schedule (7+ hours of sleep and in bed by 1AM, 95% of the days of the year)
<em>Exercise</em> Do something (bouldering, gym, or new sports) 3+ days a week, 95% of weeks except vacation. Reach and maintain target weight of around 10 pounds less than Jan 1st, 2016.
<em>Mental Health</em> Build mental resilience (either pick a book or hire a therapist by Jan 30; create a growth plan; follow said plan).
<em>Physical Health</em>
- Schedule &amp; attend follow-up physical by Jan 30; follow recommendations.
- Schedule &amp; attend dentist appointment by Feb 30.
<em>Writing (AKA, other interests)</em>
- Begin
- Publish a 500+ word piece once a month, including receiving quality feedback from friends.</p>

          <p>Giving back to open source projects you benefit from is one of those obviously-good-in-theory-confusing-in-practice ideas, like eating healthy or being carbon-neutral.</p>

<p>Many services - flattr, bountysource and gratify, among others, offer widgets that developers can put on their projects to encourage subscription donations. None has been a breakout success.</p>

<p>There needs to be a fast and straightforward tool to empower an engineering manager to say "sure, let's do it."</p>

<h3>Dependonate</h3>

<p>Here's how it would work.</p>

<h4>Dependency File</h4>

<p>Most projects I work on these days have a file with a list of package dependencies - <code>Gemfile</code> for ruby, <code>requirements.txt</code> for python, <code>package.json</code> for node, and plenty more.</p>

<h4>List of Dependencies</h4>

<p>Piggybacking on package managers files, Dependonate would take a project's dependency file and generate a list of direct and indirect projects. Each of those projects can then be parsed to see whether their Readme file includes links to any of the popular donate options (flattr, bountysource, gratify, paypal, etc).</p>

<h4>Actionable Next Steps</h4>

<p>Finally, Dependonate would open up the various URLs that would make donating as registering and entering your credit card on the services above, the lists of desired projects to contribute to having been auto-filled.</p>

<p>Dependonate would also generate a pretty report for the company to put up on their website as proponents of Open Source, somewhere near the engineering hiring page.</p>

<p>Hit me up if you build something like this, or if your company would be up for donating through it.</p>

          <p>I'm putting <a href="/2014/07/03/when-visas-turn-into-pumpkins.html">Estonia</a> on hold - still excited to go there, and hoping to do so in April or May, once it warms up again.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I'm heading to Costa Rica to help facilitate <a href="http://hackerparadise.org">Hacker Paradise</a> a 12-week digital retreat. The location has all the benefits of nomadism (cheap, beautiful location with delicious food and friendly people) while bringing together a small community of hackers working on individual learning, contracting or their own companies.</p>

<p>Here's how it happened: <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyRosengren">Casey Rosengren</a>, a Penn classmate and fellow <a href="http://www.hackthechange.org/">Penn Hackathon organizer</a>, was doing the whole travel-and-freelance thing and did some work for a boutique hotel that was down to give Casey the entire place for a couple of months, leading to the creation of Hacker Paradise. I saw one of Casey's posts about the place, and offered to come help.</p>

<p>In short: I'll be hacking by the pool in Costa Rica until November if you need me.</p>

<p>PS. Care to join, either for the whole 12 weeks or for a shorter trip? We're <a href="http://hackerparadise.org">keeping a couple of spots open</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: My US work visa runs out in a month, so I'm leaving for about a year to go travel. I start on August 2014.</p>

<p>...actually, that's it.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wait, you're not American?</strong> I'm an Israeli citizen born in Ukraine. I came to the US for my undergraduate degree. I kind of sound American because I went to the <a href="http://wbais.org">American International School</a> for elementary through high school in Israel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>So what's the story with the visas?</strong>
I was able to stay in the US on my F-1 (student) visa for two a half years after graduation through OPT and STEM. This year, I applied for an H1-B visa with a sponsor - there were <a href="http://www.happyschools.com/172500-h1b-visa-2015-petitions-lottery-complete/">172k people for 85k slots</a>.  There was a lottery, and I didn't make it. <a href="http://sites.middlebury.edu/individualandthesociety/files/2010/09/jackson_lottery.pdf">Could have been worse</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, that sucks. Anything I can do to help?</strong> It's fine, really. Thanks for your concern! I've been meaning to travel for a while, so the timing works out. If you'd like to help,</p>

<ul>
<li>Recommend particular cities that you think would be great places to live for 2 months</li>
<li>If you know any good companies that do remote work, I might be interested</li>
<li>...actually, if you have the space and aren't planning to move for a year, I wouldn't mind storing a bit of stuff in your basement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What's the plan?</strong>
Largely TBD, but the tentative plan is to live in six different locations for about two months each.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The first stop is <strong>Tallinn, the capital of Estonia</strong>.  Why? <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/european-startups">Wired swears by it</a>, and my further research confirms Tallinn should be an interesting place. I don't know if I want to work on my own ideas or contract remotely yet - time will tell. Plans are still up in the air for the next destination, but I <em>am</em> hoping to get a couple of months of skiing in over January &amp; February.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>That sounds fun! Can I come visit?</strong>
Absolutely. My plan is, rent prices permitting, to have a guest bedroom in every place I'll be living in.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>...so, are you coming back?</strong>
I certainly plan to. I love it here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Our immigration policies are ridiculous!</strong>
That's not a question. Also, politics is hard! If you want to help, consider supporting <a href="http://fwd.us">fwd.us</a> or one of many other immigration reform groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Let's hang out before you leave!</strong> Totes. <a href="mailto:alexey+beforeyouleave@alexeymk.com">Email me</a> and let's try to find a time and a place.</p></li>
