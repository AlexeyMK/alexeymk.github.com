<blockquote>
<div><span>Jarvus is a web technologies company built on hackers of all kinds (degrees, dropouts, and GEDs) and our mission is to always be developing or working on the coolest technology we can get paid for. We don't have a ton of money, and we're not looking for venture money, because we don't need it. We've been bootstrapped from the get go, and we're growing fast.&nbsp;</span></div>
<p />
<div><span>If you're looking for a 9-5 to put cash in your pockets we're not for you. If you're looking for a job that challenges you while you learn and build awesome resume experience, Jarvus is the place. We provide a high-pace technical and intellectual environment that forces students to sink or swim. Those who swim, come away with invaluable&nbsp;technical&nbsp;knowledge and working industry experience.&nbsp;</span></div>
<p />
<div><span>We're ALWAYS looking for web development talent no matter what your specialty is, but right now we have a significant demand for mobile application developers with experience in either iOS or Android Java. We're looking for developers to come on board as contractors while training for higher-level development within our framework. Pay rates begin at 20-35$ depending on experience. We've got about 12 months of project work lined up right now and would be looking for someone to fill a position for 8-12 months and train the next in line. Salaries will be&nbsp;negotiable&nbsp;after 1 month if production.</span></div>
<p />
<div><span>Students who have worked for us have added some of the following projects to their resumes:</span></div>

<p><span><em>Comments<br /></em>Actually, this email wasn't that bad to start with. It was a little bit longer that necessary and spent a bit of time on platitudes that every email seems to have "a job that challenges," "high-pace technical and intellectual environment," etc. &nbsp;The salary and exact needs were buried at the end of the email, and details about the company itself were missing. &nbsp;After going through a couple of drafts with John (and with the <a href="http://ayakanonaka.com">help</a> of some friends), we ended up sending out the following</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span><strong>After </strong>(<em>179</em></span><em>&nbsp;words</em>;&nbsp;<em>this was sent out</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Jarvus is a web and mobile development firm based in Philly looking to hire mobile developers part-time at $20-$35/hour, starting this semester. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve been looking to improve (or pick up) Android or iPhone development skills, we provide a high-pace technical and intellectual environment that forces students to sink or swim. Students at Jarvus are expected to work 10-15 hours per week during the semester, meeting with their mentor on a weekly basis by travelling to our office in Northern Liberties (3rd and Poplar).</span></span></p>

You&rsquo;ll work directly with the development team and be expected to contribute during information architecture discussions and team meetings.

<p><span><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>Comments<br /></em></span></span><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">We (hopefully) did a number of things right here. First, the exact demands, structure and offer are right in the first few sentences - in Philly, $20-35, starting now, Android or iPhone, 10-15 hours a week, once a week meeting structure.  This let students figure out right in the first couple of sentences whether the job could be a fit or not.  <em>&nbsp;</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">In the second paragraph, John quickly lists the benefits of working at Jarv.us/devnuts: they are experienced with interns , they are all self-taught themselves,  and you get to 'own' an entire project.  Finally, a more concise version of 'cool things people have built' is appended as part of the parg</span></span><span><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">raph. </span></span><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">The email ends on a personal and sincere note - "here's my email, I'm just some guy and I don't mind sharing it with you, feel free to ask questions". </span></span></p>
<p><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">All in all, the email becamse shorter, less grandiose, more precise, and more personal. </span></p>

          <p><em>This is a first in a (hopefully) series of posts on how to host a student hackathon, based on my experience with <a href="http://www.pennapps.com">PennApps</a>, as well as from participating in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/10/hacknys-student-hackathon/">HackNY</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.phillygamejam.com/2009/">PhillyGameJam</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/hackathon">hackathons</a> at Facebook over the summer.</em></p>
<p>Organizing a hackathon costs money - even without paying for the space, large prizes and t-shirts, we spent nearly $3.5k (~$35/competitor) for <a href="http://pennapps.com">PennApps Mobile</a>&nbsp;on food and drinks over nearly 48 hours. How do you raise something like that?</p>
<p><strong>Possible Funding Sources</strong></p>
<p>Here's what has worked for us:</p>
<p><strong>1) Tech Companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc)</strong></p>
<p>Software engineers/hackers are in <a href="http://whartoniteseekscodemonkey.tumblr.com">high demand</a>. Recruiting is hard, both in terms of gaining exposure and figuring out who the good candidates are. For tech companies, sponsoring a hackathon address both of those issues. Companies gain exposure by giving tech talks about their APIs and sending their developers to come hang out/answer questions/participate as judges. &nbsp;Being perceived as hacker-friendly helps get participants excited about working for your company; when participants do apply, they've certainly got at least one project under their belt. Further, Students who are passionate enough about building stuff that they're willing to spend a weekend without [much] sleep are an appealing group of students to be hiring. I don't have exact numbers (yet) but it should be interesting to see how many people ended up getting jobs or summer internships from companies they met through PennApps.</p>
<p>The bigger the company you contact, the more used they are to similar requests for sponsorship and the more likely they are to have a budget for it. Local start-ups (or, if a company wants to get its APIs in front of developers, start-ups in general) can often be a great fit since there's a good chance you can get the founders to come judge or hang out with the participants, but may have less immediate funding to offer; in general, secure most of your funding from well-known companies before reaching out to smaller start-ups; if nothing else, saying (though not directly) "Google and Microsoft are already lined up to sponsor; would you be interested in joining them?" helps establish your credibility as you raise funding.</p>
<p>[from <a href="http://7cubedproject.com/">Gareth</a>:] Contacting a University Recruiter will tend to go further at a large company than contacting a friend who works there, since recruiters have a direct budget for things like this. &nbsp;If you have a friend at the company, ask them to put you in touch with the recruiter directly.</p>
<p>When speaking to tech companies, we made a point of getting either places that students are already excited to work for (Google being the prime example) or those with a reputation for treating developers well. There's some sense of responsibility here for getting sponsors that fit in.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) Venture Capitalists</strong></p>
<p>Venture Capitalists have two ways to gain from hackathons: as above, they are able to benefit from helping their portfolio companies recruit from the hackathon talent pool for summer or new-grad positions. The added bonus for VC firms, however, is using hackathons to measure the pulse of the developer community - <a href="http://pennapps.com/2011/01/developers-dig-droid-at-pennapps-hackathon/">what phones are people using</a>, what development stacks are popular, what kind of ideas are floating around in the aether. There's also always the possibility of finding a great technical team and encourage them to turn toward&nbsp;entrepreneurship,&nbsp;building a relationship early on. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3) University&nbsp;Entrepreneurship&nbsp;Groups</strong></p>
<p>At Penn, the <a href="http://www.tech-house.upenn.edu/">Weiss Tech House</a> is a hub for student&nbsp;entrepreneurship&nbsp;and was a natural partner for us to work with, providing free space as well as offsetting all security-related costs. In general, if there's a Technology/Innovation/Entrepreneurship&nbsp;organization or group at your university, sponsoring or being part of a hackathon is right up their alley and makes them look great. Even if they won't be able to help substantially with your budget, they'll be able to help with things like convincing university facilities that it's perfectly fine to hold an event that requires keeping a building open overnight. The Computer Science department or CS clubs may also be game for sponsoring if you need it. All in all, your school should be excited about having a Hackathon: it makes them look cutting-edge and tech-savvy.</p>
<p>[From DJ]: Having some University group giving you official support also makes sponsors comfortable that your event has appropriate backing and is actually going to happen. Consider adding your official university affiliation to your website right at the beginning.</p>
<p><a name="local_groups"></a> <strong>4) Local Groups/Barter Deals</strong></p>
<p>Energy drink companies are the cleanest example of this, but there are others: what sort of products are trying to sell their goods to engineering students/hackers and would be interested in free advertising in exchange for their goods? &nbsp;We've been able to get discounts from new restaurants in the neighborhood, <a href="http://stickermule.com">laptop stickers</a> and <a href="http://www.mediatemple.com">web hosting</a>&nbsp;(that I can remember). &nbsp;The value proposition is simple: let's get your product in front of people that are in need of something exactly like this. A couple of days after the hackathon, we'll send out an email thanking the sponsors; hopefully, enough will convert or buy the product next time they need something like this to make it worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>5) Don't Charge Students</strong></p>
<p>Your goal (or at least ours) is to maximize turn-out.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Future-Radical-Chris-Anderson/dp/1401322905">Free</a>&nbsp;food and drinks (and give-aways) for the course of a weekend is a solid selling point. Even something as low as $5 or $10 creates a barrier to entry. I've heard the argument that charging money filters out people who aren't serious about hacking; honestly though, not sleeping for two days is enough of a filter as it is. Charging students isn't worth it, especially given the alternatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Sponsorship</strong></p>
<p>We had a&nbsp;<a href="http://pennapps.com/spring2011/our-sponsors/sponsors/">complex system</a>&nbsp;for levels of sponsorship that will probably evolve as we host more hackathons. If you're going to have tiered sponsorship, here's what you should do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out exactly the ways you create value for your sponsors; the above is a reasonable starting point. Distinguish the various types of partners you're speaking with; a food truck isn't looking to get the same thing out of a sponsorship as Google.</li>
<li>At each level, offer substantially more value than at a level immediately below, a clear and obvious reason that adding more money is worthwhile. For us, this was the Resume Drop: at $1,000 or above, sponsors received a resume pile of all participants who opted in, making contacting and reaching out far less of a pain.</li>
<li>Create a 'reach' sponsorship level that you don't expect to get: for us, this was the $5,000 'IPO' sponsorship level: certainly, fund-raising would have been easier if we got an IPO-level sponsor, but even without one we made the $2,500 sponsorship level look cheap in comparison. <a href="http://www.spruancegroup.com/spruancequarterly/Anchors_prices_and_value/">Anchoring</a>: make it easy for your champion at their company go his or her boss and argue for the amount of money you'd like.</li>
<li>Make sure to collect the actual sponsorships well in advance of the hackathon. Sponsors, even well-known ones, have bailed at the last minute before. The safe thing to do here is to get checks (or payments, however you're processing it) from sponsors at least a couple of weeks in advance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Contacting Sponsors</strong></p>
<p>Ignoring unsolicited emails is ridiculously easy. For tech companies and VC firms, we had a far higher success rate for funding if we first got introduced through a student that had interned or was interning at the company or through a professor who had worked or done research with them. That said, we were successful by contacting recruiters directly at Yahoo and Bloomberg, amongst others; if you can't find somebody to introduce you, going directly might be worth a try.</p>
<p>For the initial email, something like&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I'm a CS Junior at &lt;University&gt;; we're putting together a hackathon (&lt;link&gt;) on &lt;Date&gt;. I was thinking that &lt;Company&gt; might make a great sponsor, since &lt;reason&gt;. &nbsp;Let me know if this is something you may be interested in and I'd be happy to send your more details or set up a phone call.</p>
<p>&lt;Student Organizer&gt;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>worked reasonably well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We made sure to have at least a simple website up before sending out emails, to add some weight to the operation (IE, this isn't just some random dude emailing to ask for money). &nbsp;We kept our intro email short in most cases; the longer an email is, the easier it is to ignore. We included a line or two in the email about the exact value proposition (IE, "because you're recruiting on campus and this is a great way to get the word out about your company"), both to ensure that there was at least some hint of the value proposition and to avoid the impression that this was a mass email we were sending to hundreds of potential companies. &nbsp;Finally, the email was sent from a person rather than from an organization, in an effort to make a personal appeal and begin building a relationship with the potential sponsor.</p>
<p>Assuming the company responds, send a longer email detailing the exact value proposition and the possible ways that a company could get involved (sponsor a custom prize, bring a judge, etc). &nbsp;To start, though, keep it short,&nbsp;credible,&nbsp;simple, and personal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://www.whartoniteseekscodemonkey.com">quality of emails to the cis-ugrad list-serv</a> has received a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Caterina/status/33774039369519104">fair</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2182600">amount</a> of <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/code-this-for-me-wharton-douchiness-exploited-on-a-new-blog/">attention</a>&nbsp;recently. &nbsp;Making fun of clueless wanterpreneurs is good fun, but as many in the CS community have pointed out, it seems only fair to also educate and enlighten about what does and doesn't work. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/">Andrew Chen'</a>s recent <a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2011/02/05/stanford-cs-major-seeks-salesmarketing-monkey/">blog post</a>&nbsp;sums up quite well the crux of the irritation Engineers feel when getting emails like these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I&rsquo;m starting a online company that has to do with the fashion industry. I saw you through a friend we share in common; I hope this email is welcome.</p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3; text-align: left; text-indent: 1em; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br />This is our basic corporate structure:<br />1. CEO<br />2. CTO (Chief Technology Officer)<br />3. VP of Biz Dev/Sales<br />4. Chief Architect<br />5. Developers</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The irritation is basically this (via Andrew):</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard: The nerd perspective is, they don&rsquo;t need you.&nbsp;</strong>Much of the reason why it&rsquo;s insanely hard to find a really good technical cofounder is that the best ones really don&rsquo;t need you. Or at least they don&rsquo;t think they need you.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;">Because there&rsquo;s an illustrious track record of engineering-founded companies succeeding, spanning from HP to Facebook, there&rsquo;s a lot of datapoints that say that a 20-yo Stanford computer science major can do it himself, or at least with his other CS roommates.&nbsp;Similarly, the very best alums out of places like Facebook and Google have lots of access to capital, advice, and people- these are all recipes for making you (the biz founder) completely irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: HelveticaNeue-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;">and &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;">Remember this:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 30px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px;">They are not the code monkey. You are the biz monkey.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px;">That&rsquo;s just how it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, successful tech companies have been started by non-technical people (Apple, Dell, Zynga); yes, a number of the big successes (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo) were all started by engineers.&nbsp;I could go into length about this, but it's not particularly productive. &nbsp;For the moment, though: we (the cis-ugrad list-serv) are getting way more offers than the amount of time any one of us actually has. Naturally, that leads to being reasonably picky about the opportunities we end up pursuing. &nbsp;So:</p>
<hr />
<p>Dear Sender of Amazing Opportunity,</p>
<p>Personally, I'm sure your idea is pretty cool and if you're not going to be successful with this one, you'll probably make out just fine in the end. The fact that you've found the list-serv and are contacting us is a pretty good show of initiative and just for that alone you have my respect. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that: this email is one of a ton that we're receiving: this is your shot to get us interested. You want to make sure you're doing it right; otherwise, your cool start-up or sweet job offer might just end up as unread junk literring our inboxes. That would suck. With your permission, I'd like to offer some advice on how to pitch your opportunity to CIS undergrads. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it short</strong>: If your email is longer than a paragraph or two, it's probably too long. Ever look at an unsolicited email on a list-serv and realize it's not worth reading because it would take too long? Exactly. &nbsp;As a rule of thumb, less than 200 words is probably a good idea.</li>
<li><strong>Make the offer right away: </strong>Your first or second sentence should, with as much clarity as possible, explain what the opportunity is and who it is targeting. People tend to be looking for a technical founder, part-time intern or employee, summer intern or full-time developer who may have a particular skill-set and is looking for some reasonable range of compensation. Are you looking for a first technical employee or do you already have a team? If I can tell the email targets people like me at the start, I'll keep reading it. If I get through the first paragraph and am still unsure what you're looking for, I'll probably keep moving.</li>
<li><strong>Be specific: </strong>There's nothing sillier than a stealth startup trying to recruit without saying what space it's in. I get that you know your idea is one-of-a-kind, but for us it's one of many that we'll read that day. <strong>If I don't know what your value proposition is, you don't have a value proposition. &nbsp;<p /></strong>This also applies to compensation: way too many emails explain that this is "something we can discuss" or that the compensation is "competitive." Competitive means different things to different people. While it makes perfect sense to offer more or less money or equity depending on the caliber and experience of the potential candidate, if you don't at least give a range, you're making it way too easy to ignore an offer that could have been a great fit. &nbsp;In case you're wondering what reasonable compensation might be: at least $15/hour is reasonably standard for this type of work.</li>
<li><strong>Be humble and straight-forward:</strong>&nbsp;I believe you; this is an awesome idea. Engineers are by and large friendly, no-bullshit people. &nbsp;Please don't throw words like synergy and competitive advantage around: they absolutely make sense in the business context and it's great that you're thinking about this stuff. As far as Engineers are concerned, though, this doesn't make you look impressive or competent; it makes you look like a suit who is too focused on business-y things to understand the technical challenges involved in the work. Nothing is more annoying than working for somebody who you feel doesn't understand your job.</li>
<li><strong>Proofread. &nbsp;</strong>Seriously, if you can't spel or have trouble with ALL CAPS, please ask a friend to proofread your email. Complete, grammatically correct sentences are a minimum requirement.</li>
<li><strong>Get your (technical) facts straight: </strong>Don't ask for somebody with at least 7 years of Ruby on Rails experience. If you're not sure why that's funny, look it up. &nbsp;There's no simpler way to get your email ignored than to show that you have no idea what work actually needs to be done. &nbsp;If you haven't invested the bare minimum of time required to do your research, that says something about your approach to technical work. Don't be a pointy-haired boss.</li>
<li><strong>Why should I work with you?&nbsp;</strong>The most painful class of emails we get is the "I've got a great idea, shouldn't be so hard, I just need somebody to do the web design in a week or so" email. First, engineering is not web design (though web design is an awesome and entirely non-trivial task). &nbsp;Second: it sounds like you're asking us to do something for you for free, just because it's an awesome idea. &nbsp;Fair enough; but why should I work on your awesome idea and not mine? &nbsp;There's one of several ways to convince us:                
<ul>
<li><strong>Money: </strong>If you're willing to pay at least a reasonable rate ($15-20+), that's fair. The idea or job might end up being terrible, but at least it won't be a waste of our time.</li>
<li><strong>Credibility: </strong>If you sold your last start-up for $XM dollars or you're well known to be technically-competent and willing to mentor people working for you, you're an appealing person to work with and can get away with a far smaller pay-scale or even get somebody to work for free as a learning experience or a way to get to know you. Ironically, people with credibility tend to be willing to pay for work, since they value their ideas enough to not want to easily give up equity in them. &nbsp;Having other people already on board also helps and is worth mentioning. Also, in case this isn't obvious: getting into Wharton or M&amp;T is not 'credibility'. &nbsp;We absolutely respect that it's a highly selective process and you're right to be proud of your accomplishment, but there's a lot of you. Sorry.</li>
<li><strong>Sheer Charm: </strong><a href="http://www.coursekit.com">Sometimes</a>, <a href="http://lemonlime.me/">non-technical</a> <a href="http://getmeep.com">people</a> get by on sheer charisma and persuasiveness. Congratulations to the few who can get away with it. &nbsp;This route has a reasonably low success rate; if you are going to try it, please at least make clear what you bring to the table. Andrew Chen <a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2011/02/05/stanford-cs-major-seeks-salesmarketing-monkey/">briefly discusses</a>&nbsp;what these might be - can you pick up design, or copy-writing, or user research? &nbsp;Can you test?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Avoid attachments. </strong>Don't send your offer as a doc or a pdf: send the offer right in the body. I'm not sure what percent of people open attachments from list-serves, but it's less than 100%.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yours,<br />- CS Majors @ Penn.</p>

          <p>I spent Thurs-Sun of this past week in the Bay Area, interviewing for potential places to contribute to this summer and just generally meeting cool and interesting people. Let me just say: the Bay Area is awesome. &nbsp;The weather is warm. The people (that I met, at least) are incredibly open, willing to listen to some CS Junior's ideas about what they should do with their company and what the future of some technology might be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of the VC's and judges that helped out with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pennapps.com">PennApps</a>&nbsp;introduced me to potential employers; after that, one meeting kept leading to another; I spent about half the time interviewing and the other half setting up meetings for the next day. Now, I've been to San Francisco before; it's not (entirely) trivial to show up and meet people if you're just some dude, but from what I can tell introductions from respected people goes a ridiculously long way. &nbsp;<img src="/images/IMG_20110203_091826.jpg" alt="The Bay Area is Awesome" /></p>
<p>Serendipity goes a ridiculously long way; by sheer coincidence, I met <a href="http://twitter.com/caterina">Caterina Fake</a>&nbsp;and off-handedly mentioned <a href="http://whartoniteseekscodemonkey.tumblr.com">Whartonite Seeks Code Monkey</a>, a tumblr some CS guys had set up the week before in response to frustration at the cluelessness of many emails that came through our list-serv. Caterina tweeted the link<img src="/images/IMG_20110203_140352.jpg" alt="The Bay Area is Awesome" /></p>
<p>and we became a minor meme on the tech blogosphere, including reaching the top of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2182600">Hacker News</a>&nbsp;and resulting in an awesome article from <a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2011/02/05/stanford-cs-major-seeks-salesmarketing-monkey/">Andrew Chen</a>&nbsp;about how to add value as a business person. &nbsp;Eventually, even the <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/code-this-for-me-wharton-douchiness-exploited-on-a-new-blog/">local college blog</a>&nbsp;got into it. It's ironic that Penn CS ended up getting noticed more for the time we bitched about clueless Whartonites than when we got almost 100 students to <a href="http://www.pennapps.com/teams">spend a weekend hacking on awesome things</a>. &nbsp;Whatever; we'll get there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The point is, this whole thing got started because the Bay Area is awesome. I can't wait to go back.</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I am contacting you on behalf of a next-generation Social Networking start-up that is looking for some ninja coders who know PHP and maybe some Python. &nbsp;<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The idea is, you can follow your friends and see what they are up to. &nbsp;Here's the twist, though - you can "check in" somewhere and then your friends can see and comment on it. It's also a Q&amp;A service.</span></p>
<p>The company was started by&nbsp;two Harvard students, a Psych and an Econ major. &nbsp;I don't want to get into too many financial details but we have a lot of really impressive high-profile investors interested in funding us. This is going to be a multi-billion dollar company. For sure.</p>
<p>We have gotten a ton of interest from people who want to work with us so you should be pretty good if you're going to apply. &nbsp;This is a <strong>ONCE IN A LIFETIME</strong> opportunity and if you miss out now you'll regret it forever, I'm telling you.</p>
<p>Interested? Apply <a href="http://www.facebook.com/careers/">here.</a></p>
