          <p><em>When I started this blog, I was hoping to do a bunch of New Yorker-style profiles of cool Enterpreneurs that I got to meet, only&nbsp;</em><em>considerably&nbsp;</em><em>shorter and worse. Here's my first.</em></p>
<p>I met Haig (left) and Jason (right) through John Fazio, who subjected his internship request to my&nbsp;<a href="http://alexeymk.com/recruiting-penn-engineers-a-case-study">Case Study</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/images/IMG_20110325_191058.jpg" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Haig and Jason from WineAccess.com" />Haig Didizian (Penn CS '02) and Jason Matson (Drexel MBA '10, amongst other things) are the CTO and COO respectively of 16-person&nbsp;<a href="http://www.winaccess.com">WineAccess</a>, an online wine retailer based near Philly. &nbsp;From its roots in the late nineties, the company has been creating technology to make the wine purchasing experience better.</p>
<p>Originally, that meant things like making it possible for retail wine shops to list their inventory online and take online orders. When customers checked out, retail shops would collect their emails. Customers would get a "hey, come rate this wine you just had" email and be linked to a site where they could see their historical ratings, get suggestions for wine to try and communicate with other wine aficianados. &nbsp;"It was a very early Social Network-type thing," explains Jason. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As the e-commerce market became more competitive, however, creating online stores for shops became a less interesting business, leaving the company in search for alternate ways to grow. It was in that context that Haig and Jason joined WineAccess; this is their story.</p>
<p><strong>Jason </strong>had been pursuing a Physics PhD at Florida State and working on his dissertation when The Leaving (Jason's band) was signed by by Milquetoast Records. Jason did the obvious thing, abandoning his studies in favor of a tour that lasted a full 3 days before the label imploded. &nbsp;The band ended up self-producing their first album and eventually signing with another label, resulting in a fair amount of touring and travelling.</p>
<p>Several years later, finding himself in Cape Cod over the winter and between gigs, the former physics&nbsp;PhD&nbsp;took a minimum wage job as a stock boy at a grocery story. Within a couple of years, his interest in wine - "I liked drinking wine, so it was a good fit" - lead Jason to a job working for a big-box wine and spirits retailer in Massachusets, managing the installation of a forty-foot statue of Captain Morgan. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="/images/wineaccess.png" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Haig and Jason from WineAccess.com" />"I knew the fork-lift operator drank on the job," explained Jason, "and if he made one mistake, that would be it for me below. I had this terrible vision of being crushed by Captain Morgan's giant leg." &nbsp;Wanting to get into higher-end, fine wines, Jason eventually convinced his wife (who, in a random aside, ran <a href="http://www.4-traders.com/NY-TIMES-13865/news/NEW-YORK-TIMES-A-About-com-and-Adams-Media-Introduce-the-About-com-Book-Series-246317/">About.com's book series</a> at the time) to move to Philadelphia and work on WineAccess. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"I met Jim [the founder] for the first time in a coffee-shop after having corresponded online. Jim arrived via bicycle, wearing torn jean shorts. He gave me this three-question quiz about wine. I went zero for three." &nbsp;Jason got the job anyway, and has done everything at the company outside of programming (VP of Operations, VP of Marketing, etc) ever since.</p>
<p><strong>Haig </strong>was a Penn CS sophomore during the first bubble. &nbsp;"There was so much interest in tech that the Wharton Tech Career Fair was held in the Penn Convention Center downtown, comprising three full blocks," he explained.<img src="/images/84606046pcbYPC_fs.jpg" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Haig and Jason from WineAccess.com" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">"We showed up, and everybody was there: Intel, Dell, Enron. They were all wearing suits, and we were all wearing jeans. &nbsp;Then there was this tiny booth in the corner and those guys were wearing jeans too. We were like, 'who are you guys?' And they were like, 'oh, we sell wine, and we just raised a bunch of money.' &nbsp;I didn't understand any of the fancy words in their business plan, but I don't think they did either." Haig ended up interning at WineAccess his sophomore year of college and doing part-time consulting afterwards. "This was my stereotype of what a cool company was like," Haig explained. "After graduation, I ended up working at a couple of start-ups, and then at Unisys. When I joined, there were 130,000 employees at Unisys. By the time I left, there were 30,000. &nbsp;They were very good to me, but it was the opposite of what a cool company was like." &nbsp;<img src="/images/convention_center.png" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Haig and Jason from WineAccess.com" /><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Then, on a whim, he called up his old boss at WineAccess to see how things were. The company was growing and needed all the quality manpower they could get. "I said, 'I want to work 3 days a week and not have to come into the office. &nbsp;Can we do that?' They said, 'Sure!'" As CTO, Haig's hours have since somewhat increased.</span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p>What does&nbsp;<strong>WineAccess </strong>do?</p>
<p><img src="/images/unisys_logo.jpg" alt="Cool Story, Bro: Haig and Jason from WineAccess.com" /></p>
<p>After years as an e-commerce provider to retail wine shopes, WineAccess began looking for ways to evolve its business. Realizing that they had access to hundreds of thousands of email addresses of wine lovers, the company began to market to its consumers directly. From their <a href="http://www.wineaccess.com/static/our-history.adp">website</a>,&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 17px; line-height: 22px;">That's when we got the idea.&nbsp;What if we sent winery email offers for just one wine or two -- a couple times per week -- wines we discovered from all of our winery connections on the great wine trails of the world? Would anyone care? Was there anyone out there? We tried it. Amazingly, 56 people bought the wine! We couldn't believe anyone was listening. So we sent a few more. Within six months, wineries and importers were calling us wanting to know how could they have their wines featured on WineAccess.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever since switching to a direct-sales model (Groupon for Wine, if you will) WineAccess has been increasing revenues 100% year-on-year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Is that like <a href="http://wine.woot.com/">Wine.Woot</a>," I asked. "Are they a competitor?"</p>
<p>"Sort of," Haig said. "They're in a different segment. We both sell wine, but they focus on great deals. We focus on great wines." &nbsp;The average purchase from a WineAccess purchaser is in the several hundred dollar range.</p>
<p>"We're all about having a good time," Jason said, as we were heading out, "but don't get us wrong: we're working hard, too. We want to own this space."</p>

<p>Often, I'll be looking for some file on the command line, I'll type cd and be&nbsp;tab-completing and end up getting to the file itself. Of course, "cd ~/my/stuff/file.txt" doesn't make much sense. &nbsp;</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>bash: cd: stuff.txt: Not a directory</pre></div>
</div>

<p>I end up changing cd to vim, but it's kind of a waste. The solution, then, is to follow the 'click on something' paradigm from modern GUIs: clicking on a directory opens that directory and shows its contents; clicking on a file opens that file in whatever the default for that file type is. &nbsp;For simplicity, let's just use the $EDITOR for files.</p>
<p>Behold, the 'go' command:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, Bitstream Charter, serif; font-size: 16px; color: #333333; line-height: 24px;"> </span></p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>go()
{
if [ -f $1 ]
then
    $EDITOR $1
else
    cd $1 &amp;&amp; ls
fi
}</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Add it to your .bashrc file. <a href="http://zwass.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/the-go-command/">http://zwass.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/the-go-command/</a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
<p>Thanks, Zach and Andrew.</p>

<div><span>For a bit of background, <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/people/john-fazio">John</a> of <a href="http://jarv.us/">Jarv.us</a> was introduced by a mutual friend seeking advice on how to attract interns from Penn CS; I offered to help with his email copy with him if he didn't mind me publishing both versions. &nbsp;Thanks, John!</span></div>

<div><span>Jarvus is a web technologies company built on hackers of all kinds (degrees, dropouts, and GEDs) and our mission is to always be developing or working on the coolest technology we can get paid for. We don't have a ton of money, and we're not looking for venture money, because we don't need it. We've been bootstrapped from the get go, and we're growing fast.&nbsp;</span></div>
<p />
<div><span>If you're looking for a 9-5 to put cash in your pockets we're not for you. If you're looking for a job that challenges you while you learn and build awesome resume experience, Jarvus is the place. We provide a high-pace technical and intellectual environment that forces students to sink or swim. Those who swim, come away with invaluable&nbsp;technical&nbsp;knowledge and working industry experience.&nbsp;</span></div>
<p />
<div><span>We're ALWAYS looking for web development talent no matter what your specialty is, but right now we have a significant demand for mobile application developers with experience in either iOS or Android Java. We're looking for developers to come on board as contractors while training for higher-level development within our framework. Pay rates begin at 20-35$ depending on experience. We've got about 12 months of project work lined up right now and would be looking for someone to fill a position for 8-12 months and train the next in line. Salaries will be&nbsp;negotiable&nbsp;after 1 month if production.</span></div>
<p />
<div><span>Students who have worked for us have added some of the following projects to their resumes:</span></div>

<p><span><em>Comments<br /></em>Actually, this email wasn't that bad to start with. It was a little bit longer that necessary and spent a bit of time on platitudes that every email seems to have "a job that challenges," "high-pace technical and intellectual environment," etc. &nbsp;The salary and exact needs were buried at the end of the email, and details about the company itself were missing. &nbsp;After going through a couple of drafts with John (and with the <a href="http://ayakanonaka.com">help</a> of some friends), we ended up sending out the following</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span><strong>After </strong>(<em>179</em></span><em>&nbsp;words</em>;&nbsp;<em>this was sent out</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Jarvus is a web and mobile development firm based in Philly looking to hire mobile developers part-time at $20-$35/hour, starting this semester. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve been looking to improve (or pick up) Android or iPhone development skills, we provide a high-pace technical and intellectual environment that forces students to sink or swim. Students at Jarvus are expected to work 10-15 hours per week during the semester, meeting with their mentor on a weekly basis by travelling to our office in Northern Liberties (3rd and Poplar).</span></span></p>

You&rsquo;ll work directly with the development team and be expected to contribute during information architecture discussions and team meetings.

</blockquote>
<p><span><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><em>Comments<br /></em></span></span><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">We (hopefully) did a number of things right here. First, the exact demands, structure and offer are right in the first few sentences - in Philly, $20-35, starting now, Android or iPhone, 10-15 hours a week, once a week meeting structure.  This let students figure out right in the first couple of sentences whether the job could be a fit or not.  <em>&nbsp;</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">In the second paragraph, John quickly lists the benefits of working at Jarv.us/devnuts: they are experienced with interns , they are all self-taught themselves,  and you get to 'own' an entire project.  Finally, a more concise version of 'cool things people have built' is appended as part of the parg</span></span><span><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">raph. </span></span><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">The email ends on a personal and sincere note - "here's my email, I'm just some guy and I don't mind sharing it with you, feel free to ask questions". </span></span></p>
<p><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">All in all, the email becamse shorter, less grandiose, more precise, and more personal. </span></p>
