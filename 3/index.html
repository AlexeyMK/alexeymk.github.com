          <p>Hackathons are <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/ff_hackathons/">a thing</a> now. Over the past two years I've had the benefit of participating, helping organize, watching demos for, and (soon) judging more than 15 hackathons.  One of my favorite things about the hackathon community has been how quickly best practices have spread from organizer to organizer.</p>

<p>To that end, here are some "hackathon hacks" I've noticed or come up with over the past few years. If you're working on putting together your next hackathon, I hope they help!</p>

<h1>Events around the hackathon</h1>

<p><img src="/images/pennapps2012_1.jpg"></img></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Hackathon Tutorials</strong>. Especially for a college hackathon,  something like or git/python/html-css/javascript for beginners, and particular new interesting frameworks/tech for hackathon veterans are a great way to get the word out and build confidence. You're not going to teach anybody Ruby on Rails in sixty minutes, so consider the tutorials to be a chance to plant seeds and offer a technical head start.  Newbies appreciate having at least some initial guidance and a rough path they can continue to take during the hackathon. Experienced hackers get a sense of what kinds of things might be fun to explore during the hackathon. I've seen PennApps put these together the week before and the Friday afternoon of the hackathon, both to solid attendance.</li>
<li><strong>Office Hours</strong>. Greylock Hackathon from this summer (and I'm sure others before them) have explored the possibility of having Tech luminaries drop by and take meetings during the hackathon. The best time for office hours is probably about half or two-thirds of the way through the event, once participants already have a sense of what they're working on but are not so close to the end that they only have time for small changes.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Hack Breaks</h1>

<p><img src="/images/pennapps2012_swag.jpg"></img></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Swag Raffles</strong> I picked this idea up from Philly Game Jam in 2010, and it was deployed to great success throughout various PennAppses.  The basic premise is simple: offer participants a chance to win free stuff given out by sponsors if they meet some criteria (usually, being up late or answering a trivia question).</li>
</ul>


<p>Originally, this was (largely) a ploy to get students to have a reason to stay late, since drawings occurred every hour from midnight to 6AM, and the prizes (as well as your odds) got better the later you stayed. Since then, it's become a great way to distribute swag available in limited quantities, get participants to follow you on twitter (by announcing winners there), and generally create a fun environment for everybody. I worry about  the impact of too many disruptions, but using something like Twitter to announce winners (and setting a time limit to collect) has mitigated the concern.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Late Night Athletics</strong> There's a kind of euphoria I tend to get around 2 or 3 in the morning, after spending more time than is reasonable working and knowing that the end is not yet in sight.  Euphoria with a good mix of fatigue.</li>
</ul>


<p>Athletics help.  Taking a bunch of friends and strangers and going "alright, now let's do something silly" is fun.  PennApps has a midnight run tradition that is exactly what it sounds like: at midnight (really, closer to 1:20 AM) everybody who is up for it heads out and goes for a 10-minute jog around campus, jeans and not-quite-running shoes and everything. Tis a blast; highlights include the time when we jogged Dave from Andreessen Horowitz back to his hotel.  More recently, a 3AM game of ultimate frisbee (complete with glow-in-the-dark frisbee) made me happy the organizers had not neglected gatorade a drink option.  I've also heard of impromptu juggling lessons.</p>

<p>Late night athletic events have the benefit of being both fun and sufficiently out of place to be memorable.  Plus, it's nice to get out and stretch your legs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong> Bubble Tea and other excesses </strong>  Some of the more fun food hacks/surprises involve ordering several gallons of Bubble Tea (at PennApps), Red Bull Jello Shots (really) at the Greylock Hackathon, and late night cheese-steaks (via Venmo at now-every PennApps), and Ice Cream Sandwiches (HackNY).</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm still waiting for somebody to cater a pancake/crepe maker to make breakfast crepes on demand, for the morning of demos. There's probably no better sign of how hackathon-spoiled I am that I'm waiting for that.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> HackNY and Michigan email/tweet me to provide photo evidence of said crepes/pancakes. I love the internet.</p>

<p>HackNY Fall 2012:

<h1>Logistics Hacks</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Catering</strong> Figuring out catering for a hackathon ends up being rather non-trivial; the location you're having may have union or contract rules that say you can't bring in outside vendors, and traditional catering options are expensive and kind of 'meh' (no, we don't want another sandwich plate).</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of the best food I've seen at hackathons comes from working with existing favorite choices, from bringing in popular food carts or popular choices from campus or the city, and getting a bulk discount based on the traditional pitch that you are exposing desirable customers to their menu.  I've also heard that Chipotle and Red Bull representatives (amongst others) don't have a problem providing some amount of free or heavily discounted merchandise to hackathon organizers.</p>

<p>Provide variety throughout the event, provide (reasonably healthy) and vegetarian options.  Whatever you do, don't order Pizza. Not even once. OK, maybe once if you get desperate.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Room For Improvement:</strong> Organizers' Sleep Schedules. PennApps recently moved to a "who sleeps on what night" rotation, meaning that event organizers will likely get a reasonable night's sleep on the first night or the second. This is certainly better than the previous ordeal (organizers sleep when they can no longer stay awake) but can still lead to an organizing team in charge of demos at less than 100%.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here's my proposal: break the organizing team into two: a Hackerspace team responsible for during-the-hacking events, and an Event team in charge of everything surrounding the hacking: Kickoff and API Tutorials before the start, and the Demo Session and Awards after.  A dedicated event team means folks that have gotten a ton of sleep before each event and are wide awake to move quickly and deal with any issues that come up at the last minute.  I'd love to hear from anybody that has an approach they've tried and liked, and that works.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pennapps2012_drinks.jpg"></img></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Room for Improvement</strong>: Drinks Vendors.</li>
</ul>


<p>Anybody who's had a summer internship at a big-enough, 'tech' company knows about the contents of the Facebook/Google/Twitter beverage fridge, full of fresh fruit juices and various ice teas and all sorts of goodness. Since the first PennApps, I did my best to replicate that experience, to make (by any means necessary) to make the point that there were some benefits to working at a startup, and look: here they are, an always stocked, no limits free fridge of goodness.</p>

<p>I learned that getting a see-through beverage fridge, as well as actually obtaining the necessary drinks for the fridge (Honest Tea, anybody) is a bit of a challenge.  Those types of fridges are a headache to rent, and Honest Tea is just not for sale at Costco.</p>

<p>I've since learned that <a href="http://osullivanvending.com/">O'Sullivan Vending</a> provides drink catering to Google, Facebook, and most tech companies in the Bay Area.  They are expanding to other areas, though not quickly enough.</p>

<p>If anybody has seen any hackathon do an awesome job of their drinks catering, from the fridge to the selection to the constant availability, let me know - I'd love to learn and share how.</p>

<h2>Demo Hacks</h2>

<p><img src="/images/pennapps2012_2.jpg"></img></p>

<p>With a seemingly endless supply of teams hoping to demo and an exhausted audience, lots and lots of things are continuously trying to go wrong.  Some hacks towards making demos run more smoothly:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Demoing mobile apps</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Ideally, obtain a document projector (like back in middle school) a few days before the event, set the focus (once) properly, and put up a big sign saying "don't touch this knob."  Explain this principle to demoers, and make it trivial to switch one of the on-screen views to the mobile projector.</p>

<p>If not, I've had a surprising amount of success with taking the demo laptop and using it's webcam to show off the mobile experience. It's hacky, and should be prepared way beforehand, but it works.</p>

<p>Emulators are a bad idea; they involve plugging in somebody else's laptop into the projector.  Pain this way lies.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Preparing teams for their demo:</strong></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Folks, X by Y is the resolution you're going to demo on. Better be ready.</p>

<p>Don't rely on Wi-Fi working. There's no place like 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p>In general, if you have any special requirements let the organizers know way in advance.</p>

<p>No using your own laptop unless you absolutely, unequivocally, have no choice whatsoever (IE, desktop app).  If so, let the organizers know in advance and we'll see how we can accommodate you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ideally, have a second (identical) set-up in a nearby room for teams to practice on a few minutes before they demo, as part of the demo queue.  If not, at least make the demo setup available morning-of the demos and encourage teams taking a chance to practice.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pennapps2012_3.jpg"></img></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Demo Order</strong>  Use things like HackerLeague (or just Google Forms) to organize the demo submissions and order.</li>
</ul>


<p>Does anybody have to leave early? Put them in front. Otherwise, randomize demo order.</p>

<p>Publicize demo order ASAP, and make it obvious where it is. It really helps teams to know where they are in the queue in case any of them sneak out to the bathroom, etc..</p>

<p><img src="/images/pennapps2012_judging.jpg"></img></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Needs Improvement:</strong> Demoing with >50 teams
If you have more than 30 or so teams demoing (and especially more than 50), consider exploring ways to cut down to either about 30 demos or about 15 demos with judge interaction.  I've heard about the LinkedIn Intern hackathons doing this well, and Greylock Hackathon and AngelHack both did a good job as well.</li>
</ul>


<p>The worry with multi-tiered judging is this: imagine you spent your entire weekend sleepless.  Your implicit reward, prizes or not, is that a hundred or more people will get to see what you did and, prizes or not, applaud your effort.  Instead, you go into a tiny closed conference with 4 older-looking folks who listen to you for two minutes and then wait for an email with the list of finalists - a list you're not on.</p>

<p>That sucks.</p>

<p>Multi-tiered demoing needs to be done in a way that recognizes the work hackers put in.  I don't know how to do that yet; having three demo auditoriums for the first round feels a bit of a logistical mess. Open for ideas - email me on this one.</p>

          <h3>I still remember the first project I ever worked on that went viral.</h3>

<p><a href="http://pennapps.com">Cobol on Rails</a> was a re-design of the Penn's online Course Review system. The original was written as a Senior Design project a decade ago and kept on life support by the University IT.  It was (by the time we got to it) rather outdated.  It looked like this.</p>

<p><img src="/images/original_pcr.png" alt="Original PCR" /></p>

<p>Cobol on Rails was built in PHP and mySQL. It was the first serious web project that a few friends and I undertook. The Course Review folks were a student-run group who had been trying to find somebody to take over web responsibilities. They were willing to share the data.</p>

<p>We worked weekend after weekend, in 12-hour sprints, learning things like what the hell a border-radius was.  I still recall var_dump as a fond friend; good times.</p>

<p>It worked.  I emailed a link the Course Review folks.  "We're done, check it out!"  A few of the others emailed their friends.</p>

<p>A few days later, we were on <a href="http://underthebutton.com">Under the Button</a>, a well-read student newspaper blog.  The initial emails had gone viral as students started to pick their next classes., leading to a couple of thousand unique visitors a day. Every minute between classes that day was spent glued to email, responding to feedback and answering questions. My heart was racing.</p>

<p>The Course Review folks emailed us too. "I can't believe you guys did this," they wrote.  "You promised not to start a competitor!  The Dean is not happy."</p>

<p>We had to password-protect the thing (the password was 'password', and you could tell it you viewed the source).  Students went back to using the crappy old site, and the Course Review folks were mad enough at us to not take any of our advice about UX improvements seriously.  The experience stuck with me - the substantial improvement we made, and the politics that brought back the status quo.</p>

<h3>I was friends with Cynthia from Penn's Student Government.</h3>

<p>She was spending the summer working on student textbooks.  The problem was this: Penn's bookstore made absurd margins buying back used books.</p>

<p>The old, student-run book exchange (BetterThanTheBookstore.com) had closed.  In the summer of 2010, following Princeton's lead, Penn's Student Government decided to start their own Book Exchange, <a href="http://pennua.org/textbook">Penn Book Bazaar</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong> Cynthia </strong>: "You know Django, can you make this thing work for us?"</p></blockquote>

<p>I had no desire whatsoever to be a peon for the Student Government.  They went ahead and did it on their own. The result was simple but not ugly and pretty successful.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pbb.png" alt="Penn Book Bazaar" /></p>

<p>Marketing isn't so hard if you can email the entire school whenever you'd like.</p>

<h3>Meanwhile, we hosted our first undergraduate hackathon, <a href="http://pennapps.com">PennApps</a>.</h3>

<p>The winning team built an app called <a href="http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/productivity/seasprint_lapw.html">SEASPrint</a>, which let students print anywhere in the engineering school directly from their phone.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn6.staztic.com/cdn/thumb/seasprint-1-1.jpg" alt="SEASPrint" /></p>

<p>SEASPrint was awesome, and was more than a prototype - it worked. I used it all throughout college. With time, it would probably start to fall over unless somebody made sure it was up-to-date, and would be forgotten unless discoverable.  But the team had no particular interest in supporting it long term. That sucked.</p>

<h2>Eventually, it clicked</h2>

<p>Campus tech does not have to suck. Apps do not have to become outdated or unsupported. Developers don't have to quarrel with the administration.</p>

<p>Working on campus tech can be rewarding, and deserving of talented engineers' time. Building something your friends use feels great.</p>

<p>And so, we started <a href="http://labs.pennapps.com">PennApps Labs</a>, a student-run development shop that creates, adopts and maintains student-run campus tech.
<img src="/images/labs_logo.png" alt="Labs Logo" /></p>

<p><strong> PennApps Labs in a nutshell </strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PennApps Labs pays ~5 students a semester TA-like wages to create new applications or update existing ones.</li>
<li>Funding comes from the school's administration and Student Government, which makes cooperation with existing organizations substantially less painful.</li>
<li>Other successful student-created projects are supported and promoted, with a potential goal of adoption. Labs helps good projects from becoming stale and lost in the sands of time.</li>
<li>PennApps Labs projects strive to be open.  That means open-sourcing whenever possible, accepting and soliciting community contributions, and establishing open APIs for any data created as a side-effect.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Labs README</h3>

<p>I believe Labs is a model worth forking. The problems Penn's campus tech faces are not substantially different from the problems at scores of other schools.  The sorts of problems that Labs aims to fix benefit from outside collaboration and contributions.</p>

<p>I am working on a README that should serve as a guide for starting a sister organization at another school. Drop me a line if you'd be interested in trying something similar are your school, and I'll make it a priority.</p>

          <p><em>Warning: Boris and Alex are friends and former classmates. I am utterly biased.</em></p>

<h2>Crowdfunding doesn't work.</h2>

<p>It just doesn't.  You can't get the top-tier guys to crowd-raise.  "What for? It's just more complicated."  If you can't get the top-tier companies, you can't get the companies that follow whatever top-tier companies do.  You end up with wanterpreneurs tricking Grandmas out of their paychecks. You've already lost.</p>

<p><img src="/images/grandma-paycheck.jpg"></img></p>

<p>As a result, Crowdfunding-ish startups have been tiptoeing around the idea. <a href="http://angelist.com">AngelList</a> will make introductions but not facilitate the financial exchange. <a href="http://kickstarter.com">KickStarter</a> focuses on sponsorship rewards, but stays away from offering equity.  <a href="http://secondmarket.com">SecondMarket</a> works with later-stage companies and requires 6-figure minimums.</p>

<p><strong><em> Tis a shame. </em></strong> A world with crowd-funding for early stage startups would be pretty fun.  Imagine a company being able to reach out to its early users and saying "We're starting to raise our next round of funding, and you're welcome to be part of it."</p>

<p>Nobody does that, though - the legal hassle of figuring out what it would take is too great and takes time away from what the company actually does.  Crowdfunding doesn't work.</p>

<h2>Except that it does.</h2>

<p>Boris and Alex of <a href="http://thefundersclub.com">FundersClub</a> have found a way around the credibility problem, by having it to start with.  As part of the summer 2012 YCombinator class, the team has the implicit (and explicit) endorsement of Paul Graham, godfather of legit startups.  The two themselves have <a href="https://thefundersclub.com/site/about/">a rather impressive background</a> As a result, the <a href="https://thefundersclub.com/investments/">initial 5 companies</a> raising money on FundersClub are <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/08/01/eight-y-combinator-companies-to-watch/">some of the most interesting startups</a> of the group.</p>

<p><img src="/images/startuptoprow.png"></img>
<img src="/images/startupbottomrow.png"></img></p>

<p>These are the cream of the crop.  Most are likely to be over-subscribed come Demo Day. As an investor, if you aren't well connected to YCombinator (and probably even if you are), you'll be stuck on the sidelines wishing you had a way into their seed rounds.</p>

<p>And with FundersClub, <strong>you do</strong>.  The two have spent several months figuring out how to make everything work legally.  Details are <a href="https://thefundersclub.com/site/howitworks/">on their website</a>, but briefly: when you invest in a company, you become a limited partner in a FundersClub investment fund which then in turn invests in the company.  As in traditional angel investments, accreditation is required (a minimum of $200k income or $1MM in assets).  No grandma paychecks allowed, no dependency on the JOBS act.</p>

<p>FundersClub has raised almost $1MM on behalf of its launch startups so far, and an investment (<a href="http://redeye.firstround.com/2012/08/welcome-fundersclub.html">and glowing review</a>) from First Round Capital and Josh Kopelman, respectively. Not bad for its first two weeks.</p>

<p>They've got a ways to go, but I for one am looking forward to being able to read a TechCrunch article about a startup and being able to click the "Invest" button at the bottom, adorned with a nice FC logo.</p>

<p>Good luck guys.</p>

          <p>A quick public service announcement about MongoDB, for those of us new to NoSQL land:</p>

<p><strong> By default, mongo will not let you know if a query that you ran failed miserably.</strong></p>

<p>On the bright side, you on longer need to wait for mongo to unblock for updates or inserts, which makes production code run quicker.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this also means you're going to spend more time tracking down bugs that would have been caught by IntegrityErrors (or the equivalent) in good old SQLite.</p>

<p><strong> But I LIKE knowing about integrity errors</strong>.  Me too, especially when testing locally.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the fix</strong>: set <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Connections"><code>safe=True</code> in your Mongo connection object</a>.  In django non-rel, this means setting</p>

<pre><code>DATABASES = {
  'default': {
    ...
    'OPTIONS': {
      'safe': True
    },
  },
}
</code></pre>

<p>in settings.py.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

          <p>For the past few months I've been using <a href="side.cr">Sidecar</a> whenever I'm in SF.  The service is a sort of Uber meets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_taxicab_operation">Gypsy cabs</a>, allowing ordering on-demand <strong>everyday drivers</strong>, who will give you a ride across town at a price comparable or slightly cheaper than a Taxi.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Sidecar.png"></img></p>

<p>A post about the service's legal standing is probably worthwhile but not for me to write.  Should you use Sidecar?  Yes, if you're looking for Uber-like service at Taxi-like prices and aren't made uncomfortable by just how sketchy the whole thing feels.  The service is invite-only for now, but if you're in SF: <a href="http://go.side.cr/oCz">here, have an invite (and 10 bucks)</a>.</p>

<h1>The Reputation of ETAs</h1>

<p>I am fascinated by digital reputation systems, having focused on them in my senior thesis.</p>

<p><strong>Wait times matter</strong>.  In the taxi world (where a few of the drivers I've met come from), operators keep track of passengers who repeatedly order cabs and then don't show up.  After a couple of no-shows, a phone number or address gets the equivalent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbanning">Hellbanned</a> - if they order a cab again, the operator will tell them the cab is on its way and then just not send anybody, leaving the passenger stranded.  It's a cruel sort of system, but in lieu of a real-world consumer reputation system, it's the only way I can think of for a cab company to punish poor behavior, like a waiter spitting in food.</p>

<p>In Sidecar's reputation system, a passenger is rated 1-5 by drivers, but only once a ride is complete.  A cancelled ride, then, is not globally stored within Sidecar's system, at least in a way visible to drivers.  The driver that was telling me this story compensates by "just remembering people" once they have skipped out on a ride or two.  In one case, he accepted a ride that claimed to be fifteen minutes away and proceeded to "walk into a deli, order a sandwich and some chips, make small-talk with the owner, and then eventually come pick the guy up."</p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p>In Sidecar's case, I propose a reasonably straightforward solution: give passengers a reasonable window within which to cancel (90 seconds? 120?).  If they don't cancel, add the notification to their reputation system (late-cancelled 6% of Sidecars).  Let both parties know that this is criteria that drivers will see.  You'll get fewer cancellation and fewer drivers having to "remember people" and punish them passive-aggressively.</p>
